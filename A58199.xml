            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ABout the time of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> (whom Hiſtorians celebrate for finding out, and curing the Love-ſickneſs of young Prince <hi>Antiochus</hi>) the Art of Phyſick began to be divided into three Parts, the Diae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick, Pharmaceutick, and Chirurgick. Since therefore not only the Art it ſelf is lengthened by new Inventions, and the number of Mankind multiplied; but the Lives of thoſe are mightily ſhortned; well it were, if the Phyſician, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, and Apothecary, would each keep his Poſt, and not one invade another's Province: For every Man's own would find him work enough, and ſpend him time enough, to cultivate it well.</p>
            <p>But as for Diet, it is become below the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Phyſician to mind it, ſince every Nurſe and good Woman preſumes to direct the Patient herein: When I am confident, at this day, an improper Diet in acute Diſeaſes kills many, who want not for other proper Remedies; yea many, who by a right Diet, without any Medicamental
<pb facs="tcp:52816:3"/>Aid might have recovered. I could inſtance in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral under my care, who rather than they would live <hi>ſecundum artem,</hi> choſe to dye, according to the cuſtom of <hi>London,</hi> at the miſchievous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of a wretched Woman, to take either ſome of her cooling or comfortable things. And how the Profeſſion and its relative Trades en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on each others buſineſs, is too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Such conſiderations had once more than half perſuaded me to have written only of Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations, without medling either with Medicine or method of Cure. But upon ſecond Thoughts, and a review, finding <hi>Celſus</hi> of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that one Man may be able to be all; a good Phyſician, Chirurgeon, and Apothecary; and where one Man is not all, the more of them he is, the more commendable; I thought it better to take notice of ſo much Medicine and Method, as fairly offered themſelves in the way of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery. Since the parts of Phyſick are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven one with another, that they cannot well be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>It's true, <hi>Van Horne,</hi> Anatomy and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery-Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> who has methodized the Art moſt excellently well, is of Opinion, that the beſt way of delivering Chirurgery, is to treat of its Operations, abſtracted from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing elſe: So he has done in his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crotechne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the way, I have taken, was chalked out to me by the Learned Dr. <hi>Read,</hi> in his Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
<pb facs="tcp:52816:3"/>Lectures. His Method is very nigh the ſame with <hi>Van Horne</hi>'s, in dividing Chirurgery into Parts, according to its Operations. Inſomuch, that I ſuſpect <hi>Van Horne</hi> to have taken his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod from Dr. <hi>Read;</hi> becauſe I have heard that <hi>Read</hi>'s Lectures were tranſlated into a Foreign Tongue, which very likely <hi>Van Horne</hi> may have peruſed, if he did not underſtand them in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But our Famous Countryman, as he is exact about Chirurgical Operations, ſo he likewiſe is very curious and Orthodox in his Method and Medicines; Wherefore I have choſen, ſo far as he has gone in his deſigned Work, to give you <hi>Read,</hi> as he was, ſubtracting the addreſs of his Lectures, and turning them into Chapters; but varying his Meaning no more in any alteration of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, than <hi>Tagaultius</hi> did <hi>Vigo</hi>'s in rendring his Meaning in better Latin.</p>
            <p>Our much deſired <hi>Read</hi> did, in his Firſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, give a Scheme of the whole Art of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, as his intended Labours, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went through the Doctrine of Tumors, Ulcers, and Wounds; but ſtopt there, and the Work till now has laid incomplete.</p>
            <p>If any would have been at the pains and charge of Tranſlating <hi>Read</hi> into Latin, I queſtion not, but e're this he had obtained the Suffrages of the Learned, to have been one of the beſt Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever writ: So all our Engliſh Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any Note ſince him, have ſubſcribed their Teſtimony of his great Abilities. But his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in Engliſh being very ſcarce, it was
<pb facs="tcp:52816:4"/>judged, that an Edition of them would not be unacceptable.</p>
            <p>And, thô he left his Work unfiniſhed, it has but fared with him as with curious Architects, who ſeldom live to finiſh any vaſt Building; yet leave behind them ſuch Models of their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as may enable an ordinary Workman to go thorow with it. Thus our <hi>Read</hi> has ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his deſign, that thô he lived not to give the finiſhing ſtroak; yet he has left ſuch directions, as may enable a meaner Capacity to follow him.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Read</hi> has done, and other Men's as well as my own Opinion of it, I have told you. Now what I have done further, I will tell you, and ſubmit it to better Judgments.</p>
            <p>I have, according to Dr. <hi>Read</hi>'s Scheme, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to complete the Work by ſupplying all the parts of Chirurgery wanting, (for he did not finiſh one of the four,) neither from my own, nor other Men's Notions; but from the Works of the beſt practical Authors, and from my Communication with ſome now living, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my own Obſervation.</p>
            <p>In my choice of Authors, I took my direction from <hi>Van Horne,</hi> who in his partition of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, all he differs from <hi>Read</hi> is, in making <hi>Read</hi>'s <hi>Pars</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be two, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which difference, how little it is, let any one competent be judge; Since <hi>Read</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> has Latitude enough to comprehend <hi>Van Horne</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in it: And ſo, whether you make four or five Parts of Chirurgery, it is left indifferent. Now
<pb facs="tcp:52816:4"/>he, as well as <hi>Read,</hi> being both a great Scholar and a good Chirurgeon, but writing ſince <hi>Read,</hi> muſt have had the better opportunity to know the later diſcoveries in Anatomy, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Chirurgery. And ſince he has deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Reputation among the Learned, as he has cloſely followed <hi>Read,</hi> or at leaſt concurs with him (for his Parts of Chirurgery are the ſame, and he ranks them in the very ſame order as <hi>Read</hi> does,) I thought I might very well follow him; which I have done in being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the later Parts, than <hi>Read</hi> was in what preceded me.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Caſes, like Examples, inſtruct better than Precepts, they being the moſt lively repreſentation of Practice; I have out of ſuch, as on whoſe integrity we may rely (eſpecially out of <hi>Hildanus,</hi>) inſerted into <hi>Read</hi>'s Part ſeveral Obſervations, and have made uſe of them all along the Parts, that I have ſupplied. In ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matters alſo I have been beholden to our Engliſh Chirurgeons. But above all, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make uſe of ſuch in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as have been remarkably Famous therein.</p>
            <p>In the King's Evil I have uſed the Great Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt <hi>Andreas Laurentius,</hi> in his Treatiſe on that Subject.</p>
            <p>To the Treatiſe of Wounds I have ſubjoyned the ſubſtance of what <hi>Fortunatus Fidelis</hi> has written concerning Reports about Wounds, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in before a Magiſtrate, and in Courts of Judicature.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52816:5"/>
            <p>In Midwifry, I have been beholden to Dr. <hi>Chamberlain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Cutting for the Stone, to Dr. <hi>Groenevelt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Supplemental Part I have given you the ſubſtance of <hi>Taliacautius,</hi> concerning the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of a Noſe, Lip, or Ear artificially.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all, out of the beſt Authors I could meet with, I have given you what is worth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, about Embalming the Dead.</p>
            <p>That Dr. <hi>Read</hi>'s Works, thô Learned, were capable of Improvement, his Anatomy is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument; which by a late Learned Pen has been ſo meliorated in our own Tongue, (wherein Dr. <hi>Read</hi> himſelf alſo wrote,) that it now out-does all Tranſlations of any other Anatomiſts. This conſideration has almoſt perſuaded me, that ſome Alterations, and the many Additions I have told you of, are not out of a poſſibility of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſome value to his Chirurgery; but what that is, the peruſal of this <hi>New Chirurgeon</hi>'s <hi>Mate,</hi> can beſt ſhew you.</p>

                     <p>BEfore we come to treat of Chirurgery it ſelf, there are ſeveral <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita</hi> fit to be known by him, that would be a Proficient therein. For theſe <hi>Praecognita</hi> are Introductory, and will clear the Way for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Underſtanding of what ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be diſcourſed: And they are theſe:

                     </p>
                     <p>And then my Intent is to paſs through all the Parts of Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry methodically, that ſo the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Memory may more eaſily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he peruſes: And I ſhall give you nothing but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Authority of the moſt Learned and beſt Experienced Men in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>As for the Antiquity of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, its Pedegree is as old as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> But if any Gentleman doubt it, I dare tell him, I can produce
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52816:15"/>more probability for it, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he can for his Deſcent from his Great Grand-father, though he would oblige the World with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy elder and ſtouter than the Conqueror. For can we think, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> after Fratricide committed upon <hi>Abel,</hi> would not both contrive how to ward a Blow, yea, and to cure a Wound, if need were? Certainly, when their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Evil had, through amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horrour at the firſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated all recognition of Good, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt needs take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſuch Diſaſters; and <hi>Adam</hi> eſpecially, if he were ſo good an Herbariſt, as moſt Divines hold him to have been, muſt from his knowledge of Vulnerary Herbs, naturally proceed to the uſe of Plaſters. Indeed concerning the Antediluvian Tranſactions <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us but ſhort Remarques; yet we find by thoſe, that <hi>Lamech</hi> committed Murder, and gloried in it: And the Earth being filled with Violence, there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be Work for the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it cannot be imagined, but that when Men had received Wounds and Hurts, they would try to cure them. As for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Hiſtory, in it we find Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery as ancient as any Records of that ſort. <hi>Podalirius</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaon,</hi> ſons of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> were Chirurgeons to the Grecian Camp before the Walls of <hi>Troy;</hi> yea, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero de nat. Deor.</hi> tells us, That <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> himſelf drew Teeth, and dreſſed Wounds. <hi>Apollo</hi> was an Oculiſt; <hi>Mercury</hi> cut <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> out of his Mother <hi>Coronis</hi> her belly; and <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plaid the good old Woman in dreſſing the Wounds of her dear <hi>Diomed,</hi> and their Boy <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when Virgin <hi>Pallas</hi> had in theſe Heroes chaſtiſed the tricks of that wanton Goddeſs her Youth.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, to leave theſe more obſcure and antique Times, and that we may come to the Men, who have left us the Monuments of their Skill in Chirurgery, let us deſcend a little lower, and we ſhall find <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the ſeventeenth in a lineal deſcent from <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> to have been the firſt and the skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all who have written of this Subject, as his Books <hi>De Officin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gerius,</hi> and <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus à Saliceto Placentinus,</hi> alſo <hi>Johannes de Vigo,</hi> but he had taken what he wrote from <hi>Guido;</hi> and <hi>Tagaultius</hi> turned him into more elegant Latin. <hi>Marianus Sanctus Barolitanus</hi> was one of <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who afterwards publiſhed a <hi>Compendium</hi> of Chirurgery. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus Africanus,</hi> who lived, <hi>An.</hi> 1080. wrote ſomething in Chirurgery. And <hi>Petrus de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata</hi> of <hi>Bononia</hi> wrote about 1490. But of <hi>Guido, Fallopius</hi> confeſſes ingenuouſly, that except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> he not only excelled all the Grecians, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, and Barbarians, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the barbariſm and obſcurity of Phyſick at the time when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but that he added many uſeful &amp; learned Things of his own to Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: He lived about the year 1363.</p>
                     <p>But to come to the Writers of the preceeding, and of this preſent Century, I think I may place the incomparable <hi>Fallopius</hi> in the firſt Rank. It were to be wiſhed, that he had lived to give the finiſhing ſtroke to thoſe excellent Pieces, that came out in his Name at <hi>Venice</hi> 1606. for then I know not what a Man could have wiſht for more: for he diſcourſes every thing, with that Candor, Judgment, Reaſon and Accuracy, that one may eaſily obſerve, he was no leſs a Phyſician and Chirurgeon, than that he was a moſt excellent Anatomiſt. Next to him comes <hi>Ambroſius Paraeus,</hi> Chirurgeon to the King of <hi>France,</hi> a Man who by his great experience in difficult Caſes greatly enriched Chirurgery: But we muſt underſtand, that that huge Volume, which came out in his Name, was made by the Doctors in Phyſick of <hi>Paris,</hi> whom <hi>Paraeus</hi> furniſhed with an ample ſtock of Chirurgical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: They put them into Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and to make the Work the bigger, they added many things ſuperfluous and alien from the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Chirurgery. But truly I think it had been more for this worthy Perſon's credit, had he in a leſs Volume publiſhed his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cures, and Obſervations of rare Cures, and their Remedies, as he found them by infallible Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſo many years Experience: As <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius Hildanus,</hi> the Honour of the Germans, whoſe Fame Ages to come ſhall celebrate, has to his immortal Glory done. For, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Longum eſt iter per praecepta, breve &amp; efficax per exempla;</hi> and ſo in reality every man finds, what Impreſſion is made in our Minds by particular Caſes (in which Diſeaſes appear to us far otherwiſe, than what Authors make them to be in their Writings, ſo that it is no marvel, if he be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably gravelled, who has all he knows from Books) and the Cures, when the ſucceſs of Remedies, as day by day they are uſed, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening Symptoms, and the good or bad Events, are faithfully related. And when all is done, if after the Patient's death, an accurate ſearch of the Parts affected were made (which I wiſh the Patient's Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would give way to, though the Phyſicians are hindred from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52816:16"/>doing it by the vain ſuperſtition of the dead parties Friends) the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would be complete. Alſo <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Fabricius ab Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente</hi> is a Learned Writer, and has done excellently well in his Books, entituled, <hi>De Chirurgicis Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus,</hi> wherein he endeavours to imitate <hi>Celſus,</hi> while according to the order of the parts of his Body, he accurately treats of the Names of Diſeaſes incident thereto, the Signs, and the Cure which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by manual Operation, and ſo he frequently profeſſes himſelf to be <hi>Celſus</hi> his Interpreter and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator. And with <hi>Aquapendent</hi> may be joyned <hi>Johannes Jeſſenius à Jeſſen, Stephanus Gourmelinus,</hi> and <hi>Vidus Vidius junior.</hi> And for a clear conception of the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Figures of. <hi>Scultetus</hi> with their Explications are excellent, in which the Manual Operations, uſed by others, are ſet before our eyes. In our Engliſh Tongue we have theſe, who have written well, Mr. <hi>Gale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baniſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clowes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> and the Learned Dr. <hi>Reed</hi> (who ſo far as he has gone ſhall be my Pattern and Precedent.) And theſe have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Chirurgery in general.</p>
                     <p>As for ſuch as have written of peculiar Parts of Chirurgery, I ſhall ſelect ſome of the moſt approved. Of Tumors <hi>Ingraſſias</hi> has written, no unlearned Man: But he is too much taken up in the reconciling the Greek and Arabick names, and confounds his Reader in enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the <hi>Species</hi> of Tumors. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta</hi> is but an ordinary Author. But among Authors to be prized are <hi>Julius Caeſar Arantius</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius Severinus,</hi> who wrote a Book <hi>De Recondita Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſuum natura,</hi> a Work certainly full of recondite Learning eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many years Experience. He it was who left us that Excellent Work <hi>De Efficaci Medicina.</hi> Of Wounds of the Head <hi>Jacobus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius Carpenſis</hi> has written, or, who is the ſame, <hi>Jacobus Carpus,</hi> for whoſe excellent Work we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the famous <hi>Conringius.</hi> But becauſe in ſo noble a Part too great diligence cannot be blamed. <hi>Jo. Bapt. Carcanus Leo</hi> his Book may be peruſed, as may <hi>Andreas Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſar</hi> a Spaniard, and <hi>Ludovicus Queirats,</hi> a late French Writer: for there is an infinite number, who have commentated upon <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates de vulneribus Capitis,</hi> as <hi>Arantius, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Paaw</hi> a Dutchman. <hi>Guillemaeus</hi> has written of Diſeaſes of the Eyes; but we owe the Chirurgical way of curing them to <hi>Durant Scach,</hi> and to <hi>Peter Franco,</hi> who both of them wrote alſo of the Stone in the Bladder, though the firſt Writer of that way of Cure was <hi>Marianus Sanctus Barolitanus:</hi> And <hi>Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is to be preferred before all; who wrote a peculiar Treatiſe of Lithotomy, and Dr. <hi>Groenevelt</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertatio Lithologica,</hi> who wrote ſince <hi>Hildanus</hi> died. <hi>Talia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotius</hi> is the only Man that treats of curing Parts cut off by Inciſion. Of Ruptures we have <hi>Franco, Scacchi,</hi> and <hi>Geigerus.</hi> Of Wounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Alcaſar</hi> and others, who have deſignedly made it their buſineſs, there is <hi>Matthias Glandorpius</hi> an Excellent Man, and one that has ſhewn himſelf a Phyſician in his <hi>Speculum Chirurgorum. Magatus</hi> alſo in a peculiar Treatiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52816:16"/>a rare Inſpection of Wounds: But of Inſpection and Judgment of Wounds mortal and curable there have written <hi>Bernhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Suevus, Melchior Sebizius</hi> and <hi>Hieron. Welſchius,</hi> to whom we may add <hi>Fortunatus Fidelis</hi> his Treatiſe <hi>De Relationibus Medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And a Phyſician indeed ought to be well verſed in this Affair; ſeeing uſually according to his Judgment the injurious Party either loſes his Life, or is acquitted. Although ſeveral have written of Gun-ſhot Wounds, yet they are moſt to be credited who have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Camp, ſuch as <hi>Paraeus, Botallus,</hi> and <hi>Guillemaeus.</hi> But as particular Obſervations faithfully related do give a Man much Light, ſo they are to be abominated, who, when they communicate theirs to the Publick, either out of Envy or Malice conceal what Remedies were adminiſtred; of which <hi>Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmus Loſellus</hi> is guilty. But ſuch as <hi>Riverius, Borellus, Barbette, Sculterus</hi> and others, who have candidly imparted their Secrets for the common benefit of the Sick, are to be commended. Beſides, <hi>Johannes Van Horne</hi> in his <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techne</hi> has given an admirable Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Chirurgery. And <hi>Johannes Muys</hi> in his <hi>Praxis Chirurgica Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis</hi> has begun to cultivate this Part of Medicine according to the neweſt diſcoveries in Nature, as the other Parts have been by other hands. Out of theſe and ſuch other Authors as theſe, I ſhall give you according to my Abilities, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Syſteme of Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chirurgery by virtue of its Etymology <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſignifies, <hi>Manual Operation,</hi> and by Learned Men is defined to be <hi>the third Branch of the Curative Part of Medicine, which teacheth how ſundry Diſeaſes of the Body of Man are to be cured by Manual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</hi> By this as well as by Diet and Pharmacy doth the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician attain his End, which is, his Patients Health.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The parts of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, muſt be aſſigned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the main differences of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Thoſe are four in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and conſequently ſo many parts: for either by Chirurgery, Solution of unity is removed, and union reſtored; or things unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally united are ſeparated and disjoyned; or things ſuperfluous taken away; or laſt of all defects are ſupplied. Now Solution of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is either gathered by reaſon, or deprehended by ſenſe. In Tumors, although the parts ſeem to the eye united; yet reaſon teacheth us, that there is a divulſion of them.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of Tumors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be the firſt particular Treatiſe. Solution of unity appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the ſenſes, to wit, ſight and touch, is either in the ſoft parts, or in the more ſolid and hard. In the ſoft or fleſhy parts there be two differences of Solution of unity: <hi>vulnus &amp; ulcus,</hi> a wound, and an ulcer. In the hard parts there are found a fracture, and a luxation; two diſtinct ſorts of Solution of unity. This part may be called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>parts compoſitrix,</hi> the part joyning together.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of Chirurgery oppoſite to the firſt, teacheth to ſeparate parts unnaturally united: where either the comely compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of Man is defaced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52816:17"/>or impared, or the actions of the ſame hindred. Sundry have been brought into the World with the <hi>anus</hi> and <hi>vulva</hi> quite ſhut up. The conſideration of that Membrane, which is found in the Neck of the <hi>Matrix</hi> of ſome Women, is in this place to be noted and conſidered: Seeing there have been, and yet are ſo many Concertations amongſt both skilful Phyſicians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons about it. Here alſo is the Cure of the wry Neck to be ſet down. In this Grief the Head is drawn on the one ſide, by reaſon of one or more Tendons of the Muſcles of the Neck being ſhortned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Claves more than on the other: whereby it cometh to paſs, that the face groweth awry and diſtorted: and ſo the Beauty of the Countenance is much impared. To this part belongeth the curing of Tongue-ty'd Children, in whom Sucking and Speech are hindred. Not only Fingers and Toes cleave together in the ſame Perſon; but Twins alſo, and double Members of one Perſon. The conſideration of ſuch doth belong to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Monſters; not to any Art: ſeeing ſuch things are to be ranged amongſt <hi>raro contingentia,</hi> and ſo belong not to Art, which is of things neceſſary. This part may be termed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix pars,</hi> the ſeparating part.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth the third part of Chirurgery, which ſheweth the means to remove from the Body things ſuperfluous, which may fitly be called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>ablatrix pars,</hi> the ſubtracting or removing part. Things ſuperfluous are ſuch, either by Event, or by their own Nature. Things ſuperfluous by Event are ſeveral: And firſt a dead Child in the Womb, or ſtaying too long to the prejudice of its own and tho mothers Life. Here ſhall be ſet down the manner how to bring Women to bed (as we term it) artificially and ſafely. Secondly, a falling of the ſmall Guts into the Cod by enlarging or rending of the production of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which we call a Rupture. When I come to this Point, I will ſet down the diverſities of Ruptures, and the means of curing of each: which are either Inciſion, or Truſs, or application of Medicaments, ſometimes uſed ſolitary, ſometimes concurring moſt or altogether. Thirdly, the amputation of a Limb by reaſon of a mortification, or ſome other accident. Here ſhall be ſet down the moſt accurate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of diſmembring. Fourthly, the extirpation of any part, as the Breaſt, when a Cancerous either Tumor or Ulcer doth poſſeſs it. Here you ſhall be acquainted with the ſafeſt way of extirpating a <hi>Cancer</hi> and a <hi>Lupus.</hi> Fifthly, Blood, offending either in quantity or quality, is drawn by Phlebotomy, Leeches, or Ventoſes, of all which I will particularly diſcourſe. Things by their own nature ſuperfluous, are either ſomewhat familiar to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or altogether adverſe: Of the firſt ſort, are Wens, and <hi>Strumae;</hi> when I come to them I will ſet down the diverſities of them, and how they alſo are to be cured. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the couching of a Cataract offereth it ſelf. Here I mean to ſet down the variety of Cataracts, the prognoſticks of them, whereby it ſhall be known which are cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and which not, and the moſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52816:17"/>exquiſite manner of couching of ſuch as are curable. Things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to Nature, are Stones in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts of the Body; but chiefly in the Bladder. The Inciſion for extracting of it, is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Laſt of all, I come to the fourth &amp; laſt principal part of Chirurgery, which is the ſupplying of the defects of the Body, which may be called <gap reason="foreign">

Now things which are added, are either of the Body it ſelf, as reſtoring of the Noſe loſt, or curing of the Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. Of the firſt, I will ſet down the Method of ſeveral Phyſicians, and Chirurgeons; Of the ſecond, many famous Mens Experiments in curing both the ſingle and double Hair-lip. The matter of things, which is uſed for the repairing of the loſſes in other parts, as the Eye, the Ear, Arm and Leg, is no ways of the Nature of the Body. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs when I am come ſo far, I will make an end of the courſe of Chirurgery with touching theſe ſo much as ſhall ſeem ſufficient, to inſtruct ſuch as have not been verſt in theſe practices. I have varied, I confeſs, from all who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this ſubject: Nevertheleſs I have the Light of Nature on my ſide, and the Experience of all skilful Practitioners. So that it is needleſs to take further pains, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confirm thoſe things which I have alledged, or to refute that which hath been ſaid by others; Seeing I intend rather to frame an able operating Chirurgeon, than to ſet out a contentious diſputing Theorician: Beſides reprehending of others doth not ſo much inſtruct the hearers in the knowledge of Truth, as it ſheweth that, which is not to be learned, but ſhunned. Neither is a Chirurgeon contented to have performed ſo many Duties to the Body of Man while it is alive, and the inſtrument of the Soul for performing actions; but when it is dead, the ſpirit rerurning to God, who gave it, he ceaſeth not to be officious to it, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting of it, for the inſtruction of himſelf and others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it from putrefaction and annoyance, until time and place fit for burying of it be offered: which he compaſſeth partly, by Encearing of it, and partly by Embalming: of the which two laſt, I mean alſo to diſcourſe.</p>

                        <p>The General Doctrine of Tumors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrſt, I will declare what a Tumor is. Secondly, what the Cauſes of Tumors are. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the main difference of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the eſſential definition of a Tumor, I will ſet down the denominations of it. A Tumor in Greek is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, a prominence or protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Body. And from hence the Latin words <hi>uncus,</hi> a crook or hook, and <hi>aduncus,</hi> bended or crooked, are derived: Becauſe things bended cauſe a ſticking out. The Arabians and barbarous Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who follow them, call all Tumors unnatural <hi>Apoſtemata,</hi> in Latin <hi>Abſceſſus:</hi> this word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Greek Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Abſcedere:</hi> Becauſe in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems there is a collection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in any place which have left their own proper ſeat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which cauſe Apoſtems come from the Veins, and ſo leaving their own natural receptacle, ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in other parts of the Body, being dependant and weak. And Chirurgeons commonly call Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors wherein there is collection of matter Apoſtems. <hi>Tumor</hi> which is a Latin word, and by frequent uſe made familiar in Engliſh Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Diſcourſes, is derived from the Latin word <hi>Tumco,</hi> to be raiſed or puffed up.</p>
                     <p>Now bunchings or ſtickings out of parts of the Body, are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: for either they are natural; and then they ſerve for the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body, and further the actions, as we may ſee in the Head, Belly, Joynts, the Thighs, Calves of the Legs, and Arms: Or they only paſs the ordinary dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome parts, ſuch are the Dugs full of Milk, and the Bellies of Women which are with Child: Or they are altogether unnatural, not only marring the comely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that part of the Body which they poſſeſs; but hindering the actions alſo. Such a Tumor, or eminence of the Body, is called by <hi>Galen</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, id eſt, <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor praeter Naturam,</hi> a Tumor contrary to Nature. Having ſet down the denominations of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, I muſt come to the Definition of it. Of all the Definitions, two are chiefly to be noted: the one of <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Treatiſe of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. The other of <hi>Hieron. Fabricius ab Aquapendent. in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Chirurgicis,</hi> part 2. lib. 1. <hi>de tumoribus,</hi> cap. 1. That of <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> is gathered out of <hi>Galen.</hi> cap. 1. lib. 13. <hi>de method. medendi:</hi> and it is thus. <hi>It is a Diſeaſe, whereby the parts loſe their natural bigneſs, exceeding it.</hi> So that extenuation is contrary to a Tumor. He will have it to be a diſeaſe of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary parts: for quantity is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an inſtrument, whereby the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52816:18"/>organical parts perform their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more ſtrongly, or weakly, as we may ſee in Dwarfs, and tall Men. <hi>Galen lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de tumoribus praeter nat. c.</hi> 1. affirmeth, That in Tumors contrary to Nature, all Dimenſions, that is, Length, Heighth and Breadth are increaſed. But the former Definition cannot be aſcribed to every particular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and ſo it is not large enough: for in an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> extream Heat rather offendeth, than the bigneſs is enlarged, which very often can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deprehended by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>The definition ſet down by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius ab Aquapendente</hi> is this: <hi>A Tumor againſt Nature is a Diſeaſe for the moſt part compounded, which is to be named of that thing which hindreth the actions.</hi> And he to make his definition plauſible to his Readers, will have all to mark ſome remarkable points in his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. And firſt of all, in that he calleth a Tumor againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Morbus,</hi> or a Diſeaſe, he will not have Puſhes in the Face, and ſuch ſmall Eminences of the Skin to be Tumors, becauſe they hinder not the actions. He cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the equality of the Skin is altered, and beſides this, the action of the Skin, which is Perſpiration in that place is hindred. Let no Man think it harſh, that I aſcribe action unto the Skin, being a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſimilar part of the Body: It cannot be denied that all ſimilar parts have an uſe; which uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is an action, as this of the Skin; to ſend out by its Pores ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous Vapors; and ſuperfluous ſeroſity of the Blood, by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſpiration and Sweat. And although ſuch ſmall Eminencies commonly are denied to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, becauſe they hinder not the Actions; yet they be Paſſions, and Affections, which require the skill of the Phyſician and Chyrurgeon: yea, thoſe Puſhes of the Face are ſometimes more hard to be cured than great Tumors, and Artiſts many times gain more by thoſe, than theſe: Beſides this, by reaſon of the matter, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to one or other of the main Tumors. Howſoever, they are not to be neglected. According to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 1 <hi>Rhetoric. c.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; Galen, ad Thraſibulum,</hi> there be three Gifts of the Body, to wit, Health, Strength, Beauty, all which Medicine is to direct: Health is preſerved by wholeſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Strength by convenient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes: of the which <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> hath care of the Beauty: Now ſeeing by reaſon of the Face a Man is called Beautiful or Ugly, who can deny that they deſerve the care of the Phyſician, and Chirurgeon? He addeth, that a Tumor is a Diſeaſe moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compounded; if he had ſaid <hi>ever compounded,</hi> he had ſpoken a Truth: for in every one of theſe Tumors there is a Tumor conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous or latent; or a ſolution of unity, either ſenſible or imaginary. In an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> it ſelf, wherein there appeareth neither quantity of part encreaſed, nor ſolution of unity procured, yet in it there are undoubtedly both: for the firſt, ſeeing there is ſo great a heat in the part poſſeſſed with this Grief, the Humors muſt be rarefied, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52816:19"/>the part dilated, which will require a more ſpacious place than it had before, which is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the quantity is enlarged. As for the Second, the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore arctly united, muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſeparated by ſtretching: Reaſon muſt teach us that which cannot be deprehended by the Senſes. The laſt clauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. That the Tumor is to be named from that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the Action; as <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> a Diſeaſe of Diſtemperature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heat doth moſt hinder the action of the part: this is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe not Heat only, but the bedewing of the Skin with Choler, by the which it is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hindreth the contraction and extenſion of the Skin, and ſo by a neceſſary conſequence, the hindring of the motion of the Part organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, wherein it is ſeated. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, This definition may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to other Griefs than a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, as to the Headach, which is a Diſeaſe moſt commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of diſtemperature of the Humors, and ſolution of Unity, and may have its denomination from the diverſity of the Humor cauſing it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſeeing neither the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>Fallopius</hi> out of <hi>Galen,</hi> nor the definition of <hi>Fabricius ab Aquap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Genus</hi> is a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> becauſe it hindreth the Actions; ſometimes it is a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>light Affection,</hi> which hindreth not the action of the Part, as appeareth in ſmall <hi>Oedematous</hi> Tumors, and <hi>Scirrhoſities:</hi> And therefore theſe Modifications <hi>frequently,</hi> and <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> are added. The ſubject of a Tumor is a <hi>part organical,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by its own Nature organical, as a Finger or Toe, ſometimes Organical only by Office, as when the uſe of a ſimilar part is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by an Action: as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Skin, one of the uſes whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Perſpirations, fuliginous Vapors, and ſuperfluous ſeroſity of the Blood by Sweat, and Ichors of Humors in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Tumors and declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by diſcuſſive and reſolutive Medicaments. The form of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is <hi>quantity increaſed,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it differeth from all other Griefs. The cauſe of increaſe of quantity, is receiving of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humors, which is done two manner of ways, to wit, Affluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Congeſtion; Affluxion is, when an Humor offending either in quantity or quality ſuddainly with violence ſeizeth upon any Member, either by reaſon of the weakneſs of it, the rarity, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dependency, heat, or pain, or becauſe the whole Body is full, or cacochymical, and the parts ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong. Congeſtion is, when a Humor is collected in any part by little and little, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the concocting and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52816:19"/>expelling Faculty of the ſame: So that a Tumor againſt Nature is a Diſeaſe always compounded, againſt <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Treatiſe of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, <hi>c.</hi> 3. For there is always a ſolution of Unity, either Manifeſt, or Latent and Occult, and this he granteth; for he ſaith, <hi>&amp; de hac conveniemus:</hi> we ſhall agree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this. Beſides this, the quantity is encreaſed, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to Reaſon and Imagination, although not to the Senſe, as hath been ſaid of an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you ſhall hardly find a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor without ſome diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either ſimple, or compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have inſiſted ſomewhat the longer in clearing the definition of a Tumor againſt Nature, becauſe there is great contention concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it amongſt Authors, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern.</p>
                     <p>Now order of Doctrine requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that we ſpeak ſomewhat of the cauſes of Tumors: Theſe are either External or Internal. The Cauſes External are in number Eight. 1. The Air, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, it cauſes Tumors, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, and Botches in the Plague time. 2. The touching of things exceeding temperature in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive qualities, as we ſee in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Veſicatories, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting long upon any cold Seat. 3. Too hard binding of the part, which cauſeth ſometimes Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens. 4. The application of an attracting inſtrument to the Body, as Cupping-glaſſes, and Horns. 5. Whatſoever may cauſe a ſolution of Unity, as Wound, Fracture, Luxation, or Contuſion. 6. Biting of Beaſts, whether they be venemous or no. 7. Taking inwardly things offenſive to Nature, whether it be by the exceſſive quantity, as when by too liberal drinking Wine, an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Head; or by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign quality, as we may ſee fall out after the taking of Arſenick or Mercury ſublimate. 8. Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Motion, whereby immoderate Heat is procured, whereby the Humors become more ſubtil, and the paſſages to the weaker part more patent.</p>
                     <p>Now the part is weak, Firſt, by Nature, and that either by reaſon of its ſubſtance, it being ſpongy and looſe, as Glandules; ſo we ſee frequently Parotides behind the Ears, and Buboes in the Groins: Or by reaſon of the natural Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Part; ſo Tumors more often appear in the Fleſh than in the ſpermatick parts. A Part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo naturally is weak by reaſon of the ſituation; for the dependent Parts are more apt to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Humors, as the more high are to receive <hi>Halitus;</hi> ſo it is often ſeen, that it riſing from the Stomach, or ſome inferior part, cauſeth in ſome the Falling Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A Part, Secondly, is weak by accident, and that by reaſon of Errors committed in the things not natural, as Air, Meat and Drink, Exerciſe, and ſuch like, whereof much is ſpoken in that part of Phyſick which is called <hi>Phyſiologia.</hi> So that to the cauſing of a Tumor in a Part, there be required the weakneſs of the part which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, patent paſſages, preparation of the Humor, and the ſtrength of the Part ſending.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes of Tumors are either Humors or Flatuoſities;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52816:20"/>The Humors are either Natural or Unnatural: The Natural are either ſincere, as Choler, Phlegm and Melancholy; or mingled, as ſome of theſe with Blood; for Blood is no where ſincere, but according to the Humor mingled with it, which is predominant, it is called Cholerick, Phlegmatick, or Melancholy Blood. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor unnatural is Water, as in the Dropſie, for it never can become nouriſhment. Some add a Third cauſe of Tumors, the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſolid Body, as in the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia inteſtinalis, zerbalis, exompha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi> Of Tumors which are cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of ſtrange things, as Worms, Lice, Bones, Nails, Hair, Griſly Subſtances, and ſuch like, I will ſpeak when I come to the Third part of Chyrurgery, called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>Ablatrix,</hi> which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away ſuperfluities. But time admoniſheth to come to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of the principal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Tumors. In this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will leave all needleſs and fruitleſs diſtinctions of Tumors, from time, as that ſome are new, ſome old, ſome ſhort, ſome long enduring: from the quantity, as that ſome are ſmall, ſome great, ſome of a mean bigneſs: from the condition of them, as that ſome are mild, ſome malign, ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſome uncurable, and ſuch like; which either do not greatly further the knowledge and curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tumors, or elſe are to be ſet down to ſome purpoſe in the explication of every particular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Only now in my general Diſcourſe of Tumors, which is to ſhew Light unto that which ſhall hereafter be ſpoken in the ſpecial Doctrine of each, I will meddle with the differences taken from the material Cauſe of Tumors, from whence ſpring the main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Species</hi> of Tumors, unto which all others may be reduced.</p>
                     <p>All Tumors then are either ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or compounded. The ſimple are cauſed either of Humors or Flatuoſity: the Humors are either Natural, or Unnatural: the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Humors are Four, Blood, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Phlegm and Melancholy: If Blood, which neither in the Veins, nor without, is found ſincere and unmixed (as hath been ſaid) cauſe a Tumor, it is called <hi>Phlegmone</hi> or <hi>Inſlammatio,</hi> according to <hi>Galen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Glaucon. cap.</hi> 1. Of the divers kinds of it, which have their denominations from their places, and of the diverſities which ariſe from the complication of it with other Humors, I mean to diſcourſe when I come to the particular Treating of it: For I mean not to confound Particulars with Generals, becauſe this would breed Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo deprive Men of the Fruit of that which is delivered. Of all other Tumors a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> deſerveth the firſt place, becauſe it is cauſed of Blood, which is the Son of Nature, firſt begotten, and the Treaſure of Life. If Choler cauſe the Tumor, it is called <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas;</hi> theſe Two are hot Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. If Phlegm cauſe a ſoft and white Tumor like it ſelf, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oedema,</hi> unto which divers pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Tumors are reduced, of the which I will ſpeak in their proper places. If a Tumor very hard be produced of the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Juyce, and without pain, it is called <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> theſe two laſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52816:20"/>are cold Tumors. If a Tumor be cauſed of Water contained in any part, it is called <hi>Tumor aquoſus:</hi> If from flatuoſity; <hi>Emphyſema;</hi> theſe two laſt Tumors are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings of Crudity, cauſed by the weakneſs and defect of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat. And ſeeing theſe have the material cauſe different from that of others, I will ſpeak of theſe in ſeveral Chapters, as was done in every other particular Tumor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they require other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments than the reſt of the main Tumors do, as ſhall be ſhewed when we come to the Curation of them, differing them from the reſt. I ſee no reaſon why they may not be accounted ſeveral Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; one cannot truly ſay that either <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> or flatuous Tumors of the Joynts, can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the aforeſaid Four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Tumors, or that they can be cured by the ſame Indications of Curing, and Medicaments which are applyed to the other. You ſee how I have ſet down ſix ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Tumors, for fewer I cannot, if you conſider either the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the material Cauſes, or the diverſity of the Topical applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the evidence of Doctrine. The combination of theſe begets the compound Tumors; in theſe compound Tumors, what Humor is predominant, that carrieth away the denomination: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if Bloud abound more than Choler, the Tumor is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. If Choler be predominant, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther combinations of Humors in Tumors, which ſhall be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your view. When you have noted the Pathognomonical ſigns of each of the ſimple principal Tumors; it is an eaſie matter at the firſt ſight to diſcern the kind of Tumor, and what compound Medicaments are to be applyed to it. Hitherto have I Declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and of the reſt of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the material Cauſes of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>Now I will ſhew you what <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> and his followers think of this point: Firſt then they acknowledge but Two Elements, Water and Earth; for if they ſhould not grant ſo much, they could not be counted in the number of the Faithful; for in the very firſt Verſes of <hi>Geneſis</hi> mention is made of both. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they account the Humors parts of the Body, and ſo the cauſes of no Griefs, but erroneouſly; for if they were parts, they would be endued with Life, which they are not. Thirdly, they would have ſome Action, whereof they alſo are deprived: only they have an Uſe, which is to nouriſh the parts. Beſides this, they maliciouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Doctrine of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Phyſicians and Chyrurgeons, for they make each Humor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the maſs of Bloud, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural, or againſt Nature: the Natural they make either, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, which nouriſheth the parts, or Superfluous, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſerveth for ſome other uſes: of this abounding, Diſeaſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of fulneſs are ingendred, called <hi>Plethora:</hi> of the Humor againſt Nature, cauſing impurity, <hi>Cacochymia</hi> is cauſed; ſo Choler in the Veins and Arteries is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52816:21"/>and Alimentary. In the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis fellis,</hi> and in the <hi>Porus bila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> the ſuperfluous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> contained: if it leave the appointed Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and paſs to the habit of the Body, it cauſeth the Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; if by aduſtion, it become <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> it procureth Cancers and Wolfs; ſo that they hold not the natural, but thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to be Cauſes of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>The Paracelſians appoint Three Principles of all things, <hi>Sal, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and not only by reſemblance, or allegorically, but really: by Sulphur, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the fatty ſubſtance; by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> the wateriſh ſubſtance: by Salt, the Earthly ſubſtance. Diſtil Cloves, there come Two Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Oyl and Spirit: in the bottom the Earthly ſubſtance ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which hath Two Parts, <hi>Terra repurgata,</hi> the Cryſtalline Salt, and <hi>Terra mortua</hi> the Black Earth. The life of the Salt is a ſtrong Water, which if it be by diſtillation drawn, it leaveth but a <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit for the Dunghil. This Salt preſerveth the Body from putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. From Defects in theſe Three, they will have all Diſeaſes to proceed, and concerning Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors againſt Nature, the Hot they will have to proceed from Sulphur and Mercury; and the hotter the Tumor is, the more Sulphur to concur. The cold Tumors they will have to proceed from Mercury and Salt, and according to the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or firmneſs of the Tumor, the more Salt or Mercury to be required, as in an <hi>Oedema</hi> more Mercury, in a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> more Salt. This is their Doctrine concerning the material Cauſes of Tumors. In my judgment it is the ſafeſt courſe to inſiſt in the Footſteps of the Ancients, for their way is plain and eaſie; no Man can deny that there are Four Humors in the maſs of Blood, as may appear when it is drawn out of the Veins: Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſwimmeth about the Blood, which is known by its bright Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Melancholy is in the bottom, which is deprehended by its groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blackneſs; now Phlegm uniteth theſe Two laſt Humors, and maketh them tough. The Puracelſian Doctrine is full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which he maketh more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure by coyning ſtrange Words, as his Reader will perceive; ſo that his Diſcourſes are but a kind of canting Philoſophy. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I thought good in plain terms to acquaint you with it, that when any Emperick ſhall make a ſhew of Learning, by uſing theſe terms, you may find him out, and eſteem of him as he is: that is, Like that Head which the Wolf afar off eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, repreſenting the Head of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Man, but coming near, and ſeeing it but curiouſly carved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it to be <hi>Pulchrum caput, ſed ſine ſcientia,</hi> A comely Head, but without Wit.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the general Indications of Cure in Tumors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving ſet down the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Cauſes, and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Tumors, I will ſet down the general Indications of cure in Tumors.</p>
                     <p>Now an Indication is <hi>That which ſheweth what courſe is to be taken for the recovery of Health:</hi> The general Indications are taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Matter, or from the times of every Tumor; in the Matter, we are to conſider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and its nature. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the motion of the Matter; it is either in flowing, or it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived already into the Part. The Cauſes of Fluxion are Two, <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> or fulneſs and <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> an ill complexion: <hi>Plethora</hi> or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is twofold, <hi>Ad vaſa,</hi> and <hi>Ad vires: Ad vaſa</hi> is when the Veins are only full, and the Body not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding quick and nimble; this is twofold, <hi>Pura,</hi> when there is a due proportion of the Humors of the Body; and <hi>Impura,</hi> when there is an exceſs of any of the Three Humors beſides Blood, as Choler, Phlegm, or Melancholy. <hi>Ad vires,</hi> is when there is ſuch a fulneſs, as cauſeth ſluggiſhneſs of the Body: this requireth Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Phlebotomie, as <hi>Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> by Purgation. As for Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie, Three things are to be obſerved concerning it. 1. The manner: In Fulneſs, <hi>Quoad vaſa,</hi> at one time ſo much Blood is to be drawn as is requiſite; but in Fulneſs, <hi>Quoad vires,</hi> becauſe Strength is ſomewhat abated, you are to draw Blood by repetition, and not all at one time. 2. The quantity, how much then is to be drawn, the Weakneſs or Strength of the Party will inform you; for in a weak Body you are to draw leſs, in a ſtrong Body more. Strength and Weakneſs are to be diſcerned by the Functions: The weakneſs of the natural Faculty is diſcerned by Crudity of Urine, and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body; the weakneſs of the vital, by a weak and ſmall Pulſe, as alſo breathing weak and Sick; the weakneſs of the animal Function is found out by defect in moving and feeling; by the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Perfection of theſe Three Faculties, the ſtrength of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is perceived: But we muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently diſtinguiſh between lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and weakneſs indeed, and oppreſſion of the Faculties by reaſon of Fulneſs, making them dull and ſlow; for, as in weakneſs, great Moderation is to be uſed, ſo in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion we may more bountifully
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52816:22"/>and boldly ſuffer the Vein to run. 3. The Third thing to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Phlebotomy, is the end of it, wherefore it is inſtituted; the ſcopes of Blood-letting are Two; Derivation and Revulſion: Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the drawing of the Humor to the part adjacent, or of the ſame ſide by opening of that Vein, or a branch of it, which is inſerted into the part affected: as for example, if in Diſeaſes of the Head or Neck, we open the <hi>Cephalica</hi> in the ſame ſide: and even in this there is a kind of oppoſition, to wit, high and low; for in Tumors of the Groyn, we open <hi>Vena poplitis:</hi> thus they do alſo who open this Vein in <hi>Podagra,</hi> if the Gout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Foot. This kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception we uſe, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a plentiful Fluxion to the part affected, but becauſe a ſpeedy Interception is required, leſt the natural heat of the Part be oppreſſed, or the rupture of a Veſſel enſue; ſo in Inflammation of the Lungs and Side, we open the Liver-Vein of the ſame Side, and draw Blood plentifully. Revulſion is a drawing of the Humor to a part oppoſite: Of this there are Four differences: 1. From the higher to the lower parts, as from the Head to the Feet. 2. From the Right Side to the Left. 3. From the Fore-part to the Back, which we ſhall do if we apply Leeches in Diſeaſes of the Breaſt or Belly. 4. Is when we draw from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto the circumference, as in applying Ventoſes with Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Neck in Diſeaſes of the Brain, as in the Apoplexy, and Lethargy. Veſicatories perform the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But one may ask, which are to be accounted high, and which low?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That all thoſe parts which are above the Navel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding alſo the Liver and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, are accounted high: but the parts below the Liver are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted low, as the Kidneys, and Genitals in Man and Woman.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Interception we uſe in Two Caſes: Firſt, if the Matter flow but ſlowly, and ſo a ſuddain Interception is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Secondly, If we are to open a Vein to prevent a Diſeaſe, as <hi>Vena cubiti</hi> for to free one of a Fit of the Gout. But this kind of drawing hath no place in contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tumors, if they appear either in the upper or lower parts; for whether they appear either behind the Ears and Arm-pits in the upper parts, or in the Groins in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Revulſion muſt be by the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> which is inſerted into the Right Ventricle of the Heart: Now whether any contagious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour or Humor can be ſent by this paſſage ſafely; let every judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon conſider.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Revulſion, Derivation, and Evacuation; for in the former two, Motion is required, but in Vacuation the Humors muſt be quiet. In the tranſlation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors flowing from any part, we muſt mark according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> that it be done <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Secundum rectitudinem,</hi> by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a ſtraight courſe; and that is done two manner of ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by the rectitude of the parts, as the Left with the Left, and Right with the Right, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52816:22"/>the hinder with the Fore-parts. Secondly, by the rectitude of the Veſſels: As for example, The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Vein of the Arm hath a kind of ſtreightneſs with the Veins aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Head: So if one bleed immoderately at the Right Noſtril, by applying a Ventoſe to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Liver, the Flux ceaſeth: If it flow from the Left Noſtril, it muſt be applied to the region of the Spleen.</p>
                     <p>Having ſet down how <hi>Plethora</hi> is to be abated, if it cauſe Fluxion, we are to ſhew how <hi>Cacochymia</hi> is to be removed, which is not ſo much, by reaſon of the quantity oppreſſing, as by reaſon of an evil quality offending a part. Now this Matter offending in quality, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moveth from place to place, or it reſteth where it had its firſt invaſion; if it move from place to place, it is the ſafeſt courſe to abate the Humors wherein this quality is reſident by Phlebotomy, leſt it ſeize upon ſome principal part: if it be quiet, reſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the firſt place, then let us uſe Purging, expelling the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, whether it be Choler, Phlegm, or Melancholy, with appropriate Medicaments, which Phyſick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth in that branch of the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of Phyſick, which reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Health by the adminiſtration of inward Medicaments. Having ſet down the Indications which are taken from the motion of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, we muſt come to thoſe which are taken from the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>Now the Humor if ſelf is either not contagious, or contagious: If it be not contagious, the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it proceeds from Three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: The Firſt is the ſtrength of the part ſending the Humor, which it doth, either becauſe it is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the quantity, or prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the quality; we have ſhewed what is to be done in theſe caſes. The Second is the thinneſs of the Humor. The Third is the attraction of the affected part. When Fluxion is cauſed by reaſon of the thinneſs of the Humor, if we cannot uſe Phlebotomy, or Purging, as in Children, decrepit Perſons, and in Women with Child in the Firſt and Laſt Months: then we muſt uſe Revulſion, and this is done ſix manner of ways. 1. By Ventoſes without Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as when we apply a Ventoſe to the region of the Liver, when one bleedeth too much at the right Noſtril. 2. Painful conſtriction, or binding of the Parts, as Arms and Legs: but we muſt firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rub the Parts hard which are to be bound; and if we bind the Arm, we muſt uſe a Ligature in three Parts: Firſt, near the Arm-pit. Secondly, a little above the Elbow. Thirdly, about the Wriſt. In the Legs we muſt uſe a Ligature near the Groin, a little above the Knee, and near the Ankle. 3. Painful Frications when we mean to revell from the Centre to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. 4. Bathing of the Parts with very hot Water. For Firſt, by reaſon of the pain it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. Secondly, it doth diſcuſſe, becauſe it openeth the Pores. And in Fevers, by bathing the Limbs Sleep is procured, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours aſcending to the Head. 5. Veſicatories, which are uſed in an Apoplexy, Lethargy, and ſuch like. 6. Fontanels, and they are of great uſe, applied to divers Parts, for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52816:23"/>the preventing and curing of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Griefs: If the Fluxion be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the attraction of the part affected, there are two Cauſes of Attraction: Firſt, the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Part. Secondly, Pain. If diſtemperature of the Part be the Cauſe, it muſt be removed by its contrary: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is moſt commonly a hot Diſtemperature, things cooling are to be applyed, as by applying Cloaths moiſtned with Oil of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Violets cold; but when the Clouts become hot, they are to be removed, and cold to be applyed, or Cloaths moiſtned in the juyce of cold Herbs. If we apply Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, as <hi>Infrigidans Galeni, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatum Meſuis, de ceruſſa Raſis, Populeon,</hi> we muſt not apply the Unguent immediately to the Skin; but on a thin linnen Cloth; for it keepeth the Unguent from drying, and doth not hinder the breathing out of the Vapours, which the immediate application of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent would do, and ſo by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Pores, would increaſe both the Heat and Pain.</p>
                     <p>And in application of Pulteſſes, they are to be ſpred between the foldings of a Cloth dipped in ſome convenient Oyl or Liniment; for ſo it doth not hinder Perſpiration, and the applications are removed more eaſily from the part. This in your practice is to be noted, and the inveterate Error to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If the ways by which the Humor paſſeth, be too ample and patent, and a hot Diſtemperature joyned, then things aſtringent and cooling are to be applyed, Roulers and other Cloaths being moiſtned in them. Wherefore in this caſe Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Berries, Red Roſe Leaves dryed, Pomegranate Rinds and Flowers, <hi>Sumach,</hi> Sloes, Oaken and Owlar Bark boiled in Red aſtringent Wine, or Vinegar and Water, or new and freſh Tanners Wooſe, and ſtrained, are effectual. The Parts therefore by which the Humor paſſeth, are to be rouled ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrait with the Rouler, Cloaths, Stupes, or Pledgets and Bowlſters being moiſtened in this Liquor, and wrung: You may alſo apply aſtringent and defenſive Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters drawn upon Leather; ſuch an one as this, ℞ <hi>rad. torment. biſtort. ſymphyt. roſ. rub. gallar. balauſt. malicor. ſang. drac. boli Armen. ſantal. rubr. ceruſſ. an.</hi>

There are Two cauſes of Pain, ſolution of Unity, and a venemous Quality: If the ſolution of Unity proceed from the affluxion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors hot or ſharp diſtending the Parts, the Pain is to be eaſed with Medicaments convenient; theſe are of two ſorts, <hi>Anodyne,</hi> and <hi>Narcotick; Anodynes</hi> gently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate the Part, by reaſon of the conformity which they have with the Nature of Man. They are hot in the firſt Degree, and of ſubtil parts; ſuch are Milk, old Sallad-Oyl, Butter, Hogs Lard, Fat of Hens, Ducks, Geeſe, Eels, Man, Badgers, Bears, the Oyl of Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Lilies, Earth-Worms, Linſeed, Dill, Sweet Almonds, Eggs, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52816:23"/>Pulp of Caſſia tempered with the Oyl of Roſes, the Pulp of ſweet Apples with the Powder of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron. <hi>Narcoticks</hi> deprive the part of the faculty of Feeling, ſuch are <hi>Opium,</hi> Hemlock, Henbane, the deadly Nightſhade, Mandrakes, and the Apple of <hi>Peru,</hi> or prickly Apple: theſe we are to uſe when the former will not prevail, and when by reaſon of Watching, a Fever, or Faintneſs is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sometimes in extremities they are uſed Solitary, ſometimes with their Correctives, to wit, things hot, if we fear ſtupefaction of the part, unto which they are to be applyed: Such things are <hi>Caſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> Saffron, Cinamon, Cloves, Pepper, and ſuch like. If the biting of a venemous Beaſt, as of a mad Dog, or a Viper, or Adder; or the ſtinging and pricking of any Beaſt, as of a Scorpion, or Inſect, as a Hornet, be the cauſe of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, we muſt addreſs our ſelves to meet ſpeedily with the Poyſon. If therefore a venemous Beaſt bite or ſting, Firſt, the part is to be ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and Ventoſes to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the part is to be foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Theriaca Andromachi,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in ſtrong Wine-Vinegar, and Stupes moiſtened in the ſame, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſame; or it is to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Oyl of Scorpions, and a Pledget wet in it to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: And above the Pledget, this emplaſter of <hi>Fallopius De tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moribus, c.</hi> 14. is to be ſpread warm, ℞ <hi>pic. naval,</hi> ℥ j. <hi>ſal. nitri.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. ſinap.</hi>

                        <p>Of the Four Times of a Tumor, and the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken from them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving ſpoken of the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Curative, taken from the Matter of a Tumor, now it followeth that we ſpeak of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications taken from the times of a Tumor; The times of a Tumor are Four, the beginning, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the ſtate and declination. The beginning is thought to be, when a part beginneth to ſwell, although the actions be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: in the beginning repelling Medicaments are required; repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medicaments are cold, and of groſs ſubſtance, for they are to thicken the part affected, and to cool the inner parts of it; ſuch are the Whites of Eggs, Plantain, Night-ſhade, Houſe-leek; Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madam, Purſlain, Roſe-buds, dry Roſes, Myrtle-berries, Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-flowers, and Rinds, Galls, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> Quinces, Sloes, Bole, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis draconis, terra ſigillata,</hi> ſowre Wine, Tanners Wooſe; which you may apply either ſingle, or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to your ſcope. But in ſix caſes we are not to uſe repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Topicks; Firſt, if the Matter be vonemous or maligne, leſt it being repelled, ſhould aſſault ſome principal part. Secondly, if the Matter be critically turned to a part, ſo that it be not a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part, by the error of Nature: for then it ought to be repelled; as when in a burning Fever, the Matter being ſent to the <hi>Menin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> cauſeth Ravings. Thirdly, when the Body is either Plethorick, or of an ill habit. Fourthly, when the Humor floweth to the emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. Fifthly, If the Part have but little Natural Heat, we are not to uſe repercuſſives, leſt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat be extinguiſhed, and the part mortified. Sixthly, when the pain is vehement, for then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52816:24"/>
                        <hi>Anodynes</hi> are only to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>We are to think the Tumor to increaſe, when the part is ſtretched, and ſymptomes are increaſed; and ſeeing in the increaſe the Matter partly floweth, and partly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Part, you are partly to repell, and partly to diſcuſſe: but if the Matter flow with ſuch force and plenty of Humor, that it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth corruption of the Part, or if the Humor which floweth be thick, and ſo hot that the Part feeleth a burning, as in a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; then are you to uſe ſenſible Evacuation by Scarification; but where we cannot conveniently Scarify, Leeches are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as in the Hemorrhoids, and other griefs of the <hi>Anus.</hi> Now diſcuſſion <hi>is an evacuation of a thin Matter gathered in a Part, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible evaporation, procured by the natural heat increaſed by proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Medicaments.</hi> In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>inſenſible</hi> is added, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from Evacuation by Inciſion, Scarification, or Leeches, which evacuate ſenſibly to the Eye: the principal efficient cauſe is <hi>the natural Heat;</hi> the adjuvant <hi>diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Medicaments;</hi> the Matter which is to be reſolved, muſt be thin; for it is in vain to go about to diſcuſſe a thick ſubſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not apt to yield Vapors. In the deſcription, diſcuſſive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are ſaid to help natural Heat by increaſing of it; which being done: Firſt, the Humor is made thin. Secondly, it is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a Vapor. Thirdly, it is drawn from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. And Laſtly, expelled by the Pores of the Skin. Such Medicaments then muſt be famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to Nature, and theſe perform their Office, by conſuming ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humidity: and ſo they muſt be hot and dry. They muſt then be ſubtil, that they penetrate to perform theſe Offices. There are three degrees of diſcuſſive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, they in the firſt Degree are hot and dry in the ſecond, as dry Figs, Bran, Chamomil, <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum, galbaman,</hi> Leaven, Lilie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, Melilot, the roots of Marſh-Mallow, Gooſ-Greaſe, and old Hens Greaſe; and becauſe ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain, we ought always to begin with them. In the ſecond Degree are Calamint, Hyſop, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niroyal, Mint, Cummin-ſeeds, and Dill-ſeeds, Bean-flour, the Flour of Vetches, Fenugreek, Horchound; the root of <hi>Peucedanum,</hi> the roots of the Birth-worts, Lyons Fat, old Bear's Fat, old Badger's, Cat's. Dog's, and Man's Fat: theſe are ſomewhat dryer and hotter than thoſe of the firſt. In the third Degree, are thoſe which are dry and hot in the third Degree, as Niter, unſlacked Lime, Sulphur vive, <hi>aſſa-foetida, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are to be applyed according to the conſtitution of the Party, and as the skilful Chirurgeon ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of a Tumor, is when it is come to ſuch a Degree, as that it can go no farther in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſigns of it are theſe: Firſt, all ſymptomes, as Tenſion, Pain, Redneſs and Fever ſymptomatical are at the height, and remain uniform, neither increaſing nor decreaſing: Secondly, the Veins of the parts adjacent continue in the ſame fulneſs and dilatation. In the ſtate we are to uſe <hi>Anedynes</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52816:25"/>diſcuſſives by reaſon of the pain.</p>
                     <p>We are to think that the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Tumor beginneth, when the aforeſaid Symptoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to abate, and then ſtrong diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſives only are to be applied, whereof we have ſpoken before. In neceſſity we may uſe theſe which are found in the Shops, <hi>Diachylon cum gummi, Diachylon magnum Meſuis, Diachylon ireatum.</hi> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors end not only by Reſolution, but often by Maturation; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Induration and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as Diſcuſſion is better than Apoſtemation; ſo Induration is better than the Corruption of the part: Fifthly, Tumors do end changing the place, as when in a Pleuriſie the Matter falleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Midrif, and cauſeth an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of curing of a Tumor come to Suppuration.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving ſhewed the Method how Tumors are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: now order requireth that the means be ſet down, how a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is to be handled, if it tend to Suppuration, or Maturation, which by our uſual term is called Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And we are inforced thus to go to work: Firſt, if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be too plentiful; for then the natural Heat cannot well rule it, and ſo it muſt be ſeconded by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and external Heat, which working upon ſuperfluous Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cauſeth Putrefaction according to the Philoſopher. Secondly, when it is crude; for then we muſt labour to concoct it with Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are <hi>peptica</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia.</hi> Thirdly, when the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is hard, and then we muſt uſe emollient Medicaments. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments which procure Quittour, they are temperately hot and moiſt: and theſe help natural Heat, that it may the more eaſily elaborate the Matter, and make it fit for expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and this we call Concoction. Emollient Topicks are uſed to ſoften any Matter indurated, and ſuch are dry in the firſt degree, and hot in the firſt, and in the beginning of the ſecond. But it is to be noted that there is a difference between Tenſion and Hardneſs, and Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Softneſs: a part ſtretched will yield to the Finger preſſing it, if it be hard it will not; and where there is any Tenſion, relaxing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are to be applied, which attenuate and open the Pores, and therefore they muſt more diſcuſs than dry, and ſo be drying in the firſt Degree, and hot in the ſecond. A part indurated muſt have emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient means applied to it: whereof
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52816:25"/>we will ſpeak, when we come to diſcourſe of a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> In the Cure of Apoſtems, we are to do two things: Firſt, we are to prepare the Matter; and make it fit for expulſion: Secondly, we are to evacuate it when it is prepared. To accompliſh the preparation of the Matter, firſt, we are to remove Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: Secondly, to procure the maturation of the Matter. The Accidents are theſe, Pain, Tenſion of the Part, Hardneſs and Heat. As for the aſſwaging of Pain; nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotical or ſtupefactive Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have no place here: For firſt, they extinguiſh the natural Heat of the Part; which is the principal efficient cauſe of Cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Secondly, by thickning of the Matter, they make it more rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious; wherefore we are to uſe Anodyne Medicaments, whereof we have ſpoken already: you ſhall do well to apply a Cataplaſm of White Bread Crums, let the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem be dreſſed with this, or ſuch a Medicament Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>If the part be ſtretched, uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing Topicks, ſuch are thoſe which are temperately hot, not drying much, and of ſubtil parts, as White Hore-hound, Archangel red and white, Mullen, Dill, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil, Fenugreek, Mercury, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot, Turneps, the leaves of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow, the Flour of Barley, Beans and Vetches; of theſe you may frame to your purpoſe ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm; Take of Chamomil-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers beat to Powder ij. pugils, of Barly, Bean, and Flour of Vetches, of each ij. ounces, of Marſh-mallow Leaves and Flowers pounded a handful: boil theſe in Beef or Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Broth ſtrained, and the Fat taken away, until they come to the conſiſtence of a Poulteſs: Then add to it the oyl of Dill, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil and Rapeſeed, of each one ounce: dreſs the Apoſtem with this or the like, Morning and Evening.</p>
                     <p>If hardneſs hinder, uſe thoſe things which are emollient, as all manner of Fats, the Dregs of Oyl, all ſorts of Mallows, Colts-foot, Bugloſs and Burrage, Quinceſeed, Milk, the White Lilie, Linſeed, Figs, Raiſins, the Marrow of Beaſts, Oyl of Sweet Almonds, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violets, <hi>Ammoniacum, Bdellium:</hi> of ſome of theſe you may frame a Cataplaſm after this manner: Take of Linſeed Meal or Powder iiij ℥. of Marſh-mallow Roots, and White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilie Roots boiled in Water, and well bruiſed, of each ij ℥. of Violet Loaves and Flowers, and Colts-foot Leaves, of each an handful; boil theſe in new Milk, until they come to the conſiſtence of a Cataplaſm; unto the which add of <hi>Ammonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> diſſolved in Muſcadine, of the pulp of Figs and Raiſins of each j ounce, and ſo make up your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm.</p>
                     <p>If immoderate heat trouble you, apply things cooling: but let them be cold either in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or beginning of the third, for the Reaſons yielded againſt Narcoticks, when I ſpake of Pain; ſuch are <hi>umbilicus Veneris,</hi> or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Woort, Prick-madam, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green, Barly meal, Endive, the pulp of the Pumpion, Sea-tong Lettico, Ducks-meat, the Water Lilie, the Water Archer, Plantain, Garden Night-ſhade: of theſe Herbs with Barly meal boiled in fair Spring
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52816:26"/>Water make a Poulteſs, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pound of the Poulteſs, add ij ℥. of <hi>populeum unguentum,</hi> and ℥ j ſs of <hi>unguentum roſatum Meſuis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may demand of me, how long the Application of theſe Topicks, preſcribed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Accidents, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, until the Accident be almoſt gone, with the which you encountrred, and then you may proceed to aſſiſt Nature, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing natural Heat by ripening Medicines, which was the ſecond intention of curing Apoſtems ſet down by me: Now thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which help Nature, ought firſt to ſtop the Pores reaſonably, only ſuffering the ſharp Vapors to breath out, and to detain thoſe which are mild and ſomewhat thick, which are the ſecondary cauſe of Coction. In this reſpect then they ought to be viſcous and tough in ſubſtance, which are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Oyls, and Mucilages, which by <hi>Galen</hi> are called <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica;</hi> ſecondly, they ought to be familiar to Nature, and ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and moiſt. One thing is to be noted, that hotter Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to be choſen, according to the temperature of the part, if the Tumor ſeem ſomewhat cold: wherefore if the Tumor ſeem hot, only Maturatives in the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are to be uſed, and thoſe of the ſecond Degree to be ſhunned: But if the Matter be ſomewhat cold, then you are to uſe Matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſecond, yet always mingling with them ſome of the firſt Degree. And the Reaſon is this, becauſe the Medicaments of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree dry too much; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe of the firſt Degree are to be added, in the which there is much moiſture, which is requiſite to Coction and producing of Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Theſe Medicaments are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Concoquentia,</hi> and <hi>Pus moventia,</hi> and <hi>Suppurantia:</hi> ſuch ought to be hot and moiſt, as the Body of a temperate Man is, and ſo they ought neither to dry or moiſten, or to heat or cool immoderately, but only to preſerve and increaſe the Natural Heat; for a Suppurative Medicament ought to anſwer the Conſtitution of him unto whom it is applied.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe Suppurative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there be two Ranks; In the firſt, are Mans-greaſe, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth Pain, alſo Ducks-greaſe, Geoſe-greaſe, Hens-greaſe, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, ſweet ſallet Oyl, Mallows, ſweet Butter, Figs, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, Lily-roots, Linſeed, Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flour; a Cataplaſm made of Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flour, Water and Oyl, an Emplaſter made of yellow Wax, and Oyl called <hi>Cerelaeum,</hi> Violet-leaves and flowers, Saffron; For an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will ſet down the deſcription of a Suppurative. Cataplaſm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſome of theſe of the firſt Rank: Take of Milk a pint, in the which boil of Wheat-flour a quarter of a pound, of Violet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, and Mallow-leaves ſtamped, of each a handful, of Lily-roots, and Figs boiled in Water, until they be ſoft, of each two ounces; when they are come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a Poulteſs, add of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron beat to powder a dram, of the Oyl of Linſeed, ſweet Almonds, Lilies, and Mans-greeſe, of each one ounce, and ſo make up your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, If the Tumor be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52816:26"/>hot, mingle always with your Suppuratives thoſe things which are cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree, as Violet-leaves, Lettuce, the pulp of Pompions, Grownſil, Succory, Dandelion, and ſuch like. If on a ſudden you be called, and be required to dreſs a Tumor tending to Suppuration, you may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Apothecaries ſhop, and with theſe things dreſs it. Firſt, beat ſome Oyl of Violets and fair Spring-water together, taking two ſpoonfuls of Oyl, and one of Water, with the which embrocate the Tumor; then apply a Pledget moiſtened in this, upon the part which is like to break, or be opened: and above the Pledget, <hi>Diachylon ſimplex</hi> if the Tumor be hot, or <hi>Diachylon cum gummi</hi> if it be but a little exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary temperament.</p>
                     <p>Suppuratives of the ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are theſe; <hi>Terebinthina, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Galbanum, Sagapenum, Gummi elemi, Pix navalis,</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie Pitch, Saffron, Leaven, Fenugreek, Onyons and Garlick roſted under the Embers, old But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Oyl of Chamomil, and Dill, old Hens-greaſe, Badgers-greaſe, and Bears and Dogs-greaſe, Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flour, Flour of Linſeed. In the Shops there are <hi>Emplaſtrum de mucilaginibus, Dialthaea cum gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, Diachylon cum gummi, Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon magnum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I will ſet down a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicament, framed of theſe Simples: Take of the Roots of white Lilies, of the Roots of Marſh-mallow, of Onyons boiled and bruiſed, with the Liquor of each iiij ℥. of Leaven ij ℥. of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed-meal j ℥. and a half, of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron beat to powder a dram, of <hi>Ammoniacum</hi> and <hi>Galbanum</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Muſcadine, and the pulp of Figs, of each j ℥. of Oyl of Chamomil and Lilies, ſo much as will make a Cataplaſm of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>In Strumes, and <hi>Bubo</hi>'s <hi>venereal,</hi> uſe this: take of <hi>Diachylon cum gummi,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum de muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginibus,</hi> of each j ℥. of Garlick and Onyons roſted under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each ℥ ij. of <hi>Dialthaea cum gummi,</hi> Mans-greaſe, and Bears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe of each ℥ j. make a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument. One thing I would have you to note, that Suppuratives of this Degree are fitteſt for all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Tumors, and that to all ſuch, Onyons and Garlick roſted, and mingled with other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are to be applied, for being thus prepared, they loſe their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, attract, and become familiar to the Natural Heat.</p>

                        <p>The ſigns of Maturation, are; I. The Tumor, by contracting it ſelf, ſeemeth leſs than it was in the ſtate; for while the Natural

II. The Tumor draws it ſelf to a point, or prominence; becauſe when Nature overcomes the Matter, it draws it together, and draws it to the skin. III. Hardneſs and tenſion are much abated; for Maturation being procured, many Vapors are diſcuſſed, which before ſtretched, and made the skin hard. IV. By preſſing the Matter with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we find a fluctuation or coming and going of it: but we muſt be circumſpect when a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in a great Joynt is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as in the Knee; for if we preſs lateral parts of it, a certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation will appear. V. The party feeleth much eaſe in the part; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſome of the ſharp Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors are reſolved; partly, becauſe the Matter concocted doth make the parts more looſe. VI. The vehement Heat ceaſeth; for the Humor being come to Maturation, the unnatural Heat abateth, and the natural Heat reſteth. VII. If the part inflamed hath changed the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of red is become white, and chiefly in the pointed place. VIII. The Scarf skin becometh ſhriveled, and ruffled; and this is a good ſign, for it ſheweth that unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat hath left it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing which we ſaid was to be reſolved upon, was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments with the which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtems are to be opened. They are three; I. The Lancet or Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-knife, of the which there be divers forms ſet down by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: of the which we will ſpeak, when we come to diſcourſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Operations for the which they are required. II. Is the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick or Pyrotical Medicament. III. The Actual Cautery, which we will leave willingly to Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches, unleſs we be deſtitute of other means, and when we are to make a Fontanel, or to ſtay a great Flux of Blood, or to dry a Carious Bone, or to correct a Cancerous part after that it is extirpate.</p>
                        <p>As for the Steel Inſtruments, we are to uſe them. Firſt, if Apoſtems be in the Face, to avoid the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Scar, after the Curati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, in ſmall Tumors: for ſo they will be the ſooner whole.</p>
                        <p>As for Cauſtick Medicaments, we uſe two ſorts of them: the firſt is made of the ſtrongeſt Sope-lees, boiled to the conſiſtence of a ſoft Stone. The ſecond is made of the like Lee, and unſlaked Lime, boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the form of a firm unguent. The firſt is beſt in Tumors which poſſeſs the convex part. The ſecond is moſt convenient, if they be in parts concave or hollow.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Pyrotical Medicaments are moſt fit to be uſed in five Caſes: I. If we intend to keep the Tumor long open, as is requiſite in all conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tumors, in the Plague, and Pox: for where the Cauſtick is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, there is always loſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and by it we make the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice round, which of all other Figures moſt ſlowly is cured. II. In large Apoſtems Cauſticks are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; for by them, making as large an Orifice as we will, we ſhall ſpare tenting and enlarging of it; beſides, the ſtretched parts will the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52816:27"/>ſooner be contracted. III. They are to be uſed in deep Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as happen in the Belly and Back, for ſo the Matter ſhall have a readier way for Evacuation. IV. They are beſt, when a Flux of Blood may be expected. V. We apply them, when we will gratifie timorous perſons.</p>
                        <p>When we are come to open the part, then theſe things are to be obſerved: I. The Nature of the Part: this teacheth us, to ſhun Veins and Arteries by reaſon of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage; and Nerves, Tendons and Membranes by reaſon of the pain which enſueth. II. If the Skin only be to be divided, then the Apertion is to be made ſtrait; but if a Muſcle alſo be to be incided, it muſt be done according to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of it. III. Apertion muſt be made in the depending part, becauſe the Matter will be more readily ſo drawn out. IV. It muſt be done where the part is thinneſt, for ſo leſs pain is cauſed. V. The Apertion muſt be proportionate; for if it be too little, then the Matter, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be thick or grumous, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well drawn without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which maketh way for Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Fiſtulation. If it be too large; Firſt, the Scar will be the more ugly; Secondly, the parts ſubjacent will be made more apt to be altered, by receiving the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the cold air. VI. We are to know how much Matter is to be evacuated at one time: In great Tumors, and thoſe which are in the Joynts, great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be uſed; for with the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Spirits breath out, and ſo are ſpent: from whence extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, yea, and Death ſometimes enſueth. The Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon who is to do this, ought to be reſolute, chearful in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſpeech, and no ways ſcrupulous: otherwiſe he ſhall make the Patient diſmayed, and fearful, which doth much weaken and abate the courage of the Patient.</p>
                        <p>Things to be obſerved after the opening of an Apoſtem, are theſe: Firſt, the removing of Accidents which moſt commonly fall out. Secondly, the manner of dreſſing. The Accidents are moſt commonly three, Fainting, chiefly if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be Children or Women, but above theſe, Effeminate Men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Pain. Thirdly, a Flux of Blood.</p>
                        <p>As for Fainting, we may labour to prevent it by giving the Patient a Caudle, Aleberry, or ſome ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick Wine with a Toaſt, as Alegant and Tent; or if it be like to enſue, we may give them ſome Cordial Water with Sugar, as Cinamon Water, Treacle Water, or <hi>Aqua coeleſtis.</hi> If pain enſue, let the part be embrocated with Oyl of Roſes, and the third part of Wine beaten together: yet the Oyl is not to touch the brims, if Apertion hath been made by Inciſion, leſt it cauſe Spungeous Fleſh to grow. As for ſtaying of Blood, I will ſet down the fitteſt, and moſt effectual means to perform this, when I ſhall come to diſcourſe of Wounds, for in them it doth moſt commonly fall out.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the manner of dreſſing after opening: If this hath been done by Inciſion, either a Tent, if it be ſmall, or Doſels with Pledgets armed with ſome reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Powder, as Bole, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52816:28"/>and Flour tempered with the Whites of Eggs, if it be large, are to be uſed: and ſo it is to remain for the ſpace of four and twenty hours. If the Cauſtick be applied, then <hi>Dialthaea ſimplex,</hi> or ſweet Butter melted in a Saucer, are fit to be uſed until the Eſchare fall; then the Cavity is to be Incarnate: If in the mean time Spungeous Fleſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it is to be removed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theretical Medicaments, as Mercury precipitate alone in gentle Bodies, or mingled with Alume, taking the third part of this in harder Bodies: yea, you ſhall be enforced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to uſe <hi>Pulvis ſine pari,</hi> and other <hi>Fiſtula</hi> Powders with ſome Medicaments which cool and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain, as <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleum,</hi> and <hi>Roſatum Meſuis:</hi> take my word, <hi>Baſilicum</hi> and <hi>Aureum</hi> are not ſo fit.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all it is to be ſealed up with Epulotical Medicaments, as <hi>Diapalma, Emplaſtrum de minio, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum comitiſſae,</hi> and <hi>Deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum rubeum.</hi> If a Tumor end into an Induration, it muſt be cured as a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> whereof I will ſpeak in its proper place. If it end in the Corruption of the Part, the way of Dreſſing this ſhall be ſet down in my Diſcourſes of <hi>Gangraena</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> If a Tumor ceaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Matter removeth from one place to another, as when <hi>Pleuritis</hi> endeth in <hi>Empyema,</hi> neither doth this belong to this place.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of a Phlegmon.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HItherto I have delivered a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Method, common to the Cure of all particular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: now it remains that the uſe of the General Method be ſhewed in every ſpecial Tumor. Of all which a Phlegmon doth firſt offer it ſelf: Firſt, becauſe it is cauſed by the moſt excellent Humor, to wit, Blood, the Matter of Spirits, and the Store-houſe of life. Secondly, becauſe it is moſt frequent. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe very often, as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom, it accompanieth other Griefs, as Wounds, Contuſions, Ulcers, Luxations, and Fractures, as <hi>Galen</hi> noteth.</p>
                     <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, from whence <hi>flagro</hi> to burn, by reaſon of the heat of it.</p>
                     <p>A Phlegmon is a <hi>Tumor hot, proceeding from the affluxion of Blood to any part.</hi> In this Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where it is ſaid to be hot, in this it is diſtinguiſhed from an <hi>Oedema</hi> and a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> and in this that it is ſaid to proceed from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52816:28"/>Blood, it is diſtinguiſhed from an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> cauſed of Choler. The differences are taken either from the Material Cauſe of it, or elſe from ſome parts which it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. The differences of it taken from the Matter are theſe: It is either <hi>Legitima,</hi> or <hi>Notha,</hi> either truly bred, or elſe baſtardly.</p>
                     <p>A proper Phlegmon, is cauſed by good Blood, only offending in quantity: Good Blood is diſcerned by Colour, Taſte and Conſiſtence: In Colour it is Red, in Taſte Sweet, in Conſiſtence Mean, between Thick and Thin: of all other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors it is moſt plentiful in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe it affordeth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the Fleſhy Parts, as they have their being by it, next unto Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a true Phlegmon, are ſix. I. This Tumor begins ſuddenly, and increaſes ſpeedily, becauſe the Matter is plentiful, and the ways by which it is ſent, very patent and large. II. It is very hot in reſpect of an <hi>Oedema</hi> and a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> but yet not ſo burning as an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> III. The Colour of the Part is of a freſh ruddy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. IV. In this Tumor there is great Pain with Pulſation. V. There is a great Tenſion in the Part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the unnatural Heat raiſeth plenty of Vapors which diſtend the Part. VI. The Veins, which before lay hid, become conſpicuous and appear either ruddy or blackiſh.</p>
                     <p>Now as I ſaid, there be many differences of Phlegmons taken from the parts which they invade: for if it ſieſe upon the <hi>Meninges</hi> or Membranes of the Brain, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; if the <hi>Conjunctiva</hi> of the Eye, then it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; if the Muſcles of the Throat, it is termed <hi>Angina;</hi> if the <hi>Pleura,</hi> it is named <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, if the Kidneys, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, if the Emunctory of the Heart and Liver, <hi>Bubo;</hi> of the Brain, <hi>Parotis;</hi> of the Gums, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulis;</hi> of the Almonds, <hi>Pariſthmia, Tonſillae:</hi> Phlegmons in other parts have no proper Names, and even theſe I will refer to the particular practice of Phyſick, wherein they are handled, and reſt contented with the Doctrine of External Tumors.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Inflammations, if they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the external Parts, and be but moderate, are healthful; as thoſe which either by reaſon of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Malignity of the Humor, threaten a Gangrene and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are to be ſuſpected. A Phlegmon which happens in a young Body, in a hot and thin Part, the Body being not very Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and in the Summer time, is more ſpeedily cured; but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, if the conditions be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. The Indications curative of a true Phlegmon are taken from the times of it: The Means by which we cure are two, a convenient Diet, and Artificial Application of apt means for curing of the Tumor.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning therefore, we muſt preſcribe ſuch a Dyet as is able to hinder the increaſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Blood, and the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is already bred: wherefore the Dyet muſt be ſpare and ſlender, only ſufficient to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain Nature, and withal cooling: the Patient then ſhall reſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chicken and Veal Broth with Bread, Calves-feet and Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtewed, and ſeaſoned with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52816:29"/>Vinegar, thin Oatmeal-Gruel, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, Sallets made of Sorrel, Spinage, Purſlain boiled in thin Chicken or Veal-broth, ſeaſoned with ſome Vinegar, Verjuyce and Sugar; let his drink be ſmall Beer or Ale, altered in the Summer with Burrage, Bugloſs, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, Barley-water, fair Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein the cruſt of a Loaf hath been boiled, and made plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with <hi>Oxyſaceharuin,</hi> or <hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel diureticum,</hi> mingling with a pint of the Water one Ounce and an half of the Syrup. If the Party be weak, Almond-Milk made of Barley-water, or the thin Broth of a Chicken may be permitted: If we intend to make the Blood unapt to motion, and to detain it in its own receptacles, then we muſt inſtitute a Diet, having theſe three qualities: Firſt, it muſt cool: Secondly, it muſt make a conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and purſing up of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: Thirdly, it muſt be Diureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or move Urine, for much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity being carried away by the paſſages of Urine, the Blood muſt be made thicker, and therefore not ſo apt to flow. But we muſt take heed that ſuch a Diet be only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to ſuch as are in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant age, and have large Veins; otherwiſe, we ſhall cauſe new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and multiply griefs: Now to this purpoſe you may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Broths, wherein Lettuce, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Spinage, Purſlain, Marigold-Flowers, Columbine-Flowers and Leaves have been boiled, Calves, Sheeps, and Lambs Heads boiled, with Green Sawce made of Sorrel, or <hi>Alleluja,</hi> beware of <hi>Alliaria,</hi> Jack of the Hedge, or thoſe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are hot. Young Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens with Gooſeberry ſawce, are good, and ſuch like. We muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Wine, Fleſh, Eggs, fat things, and ſuch as breed too much Blood; and Spices, becauſe they heat the Blood; and piercing Drinks, as ſtale Beer or Ale, becauſe they further the Fluxion of Blood. To procure Urine, an Almond-Milk may be made of a Ptiſan, having an emulſion of Seeds of Pompion, Gourd, Musk-melon, Cucumber, Lettuce, Purſlain, and Plantain. Now the Humor flowing immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately we muſt labour to ſtay, by abating of it, and that by two manner of ways, by Phlebotomy and Purgation.</p>
                     <p>As for Phlebotomy, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation be great, the Party young and ſtrong, and full of Blood, in the Spring time we may take a pound at a time; yea more, and iterate it if occaſion be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In others, moderation is to be uſed, according to the ſtrength of the Patient. If a Phlegmon poſſeſs the parts which are above the Liver, then the Veins of the Arms and upper parts are to be opened: but if it invade the parts which are under the Liver, as the Kidneys and Genitals, then the branches of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, are to be opened in the Hams or Aukles. One thing is to be noted in Phlebotomy; that we open not Veins too far diſtant from the part affected, as <hi>Vena frontis</hi> in diſeaſes of the Feet; for we ſhould evacuate too great a quantity of blood, before we ſhould intercept any tending to the part affected. If a Phlegmon hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the ſtaying of the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood from any part, as from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52816:29"/>the Noſe, the Womb, the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhodes, means muſt be uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure theſe accuſtomed evacuations.</p>
                     <p>As for Purgation, one may doubt whether it do any good, ſeeing no Blood, the matter of a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, can be by this means ſpent. I Anſwer, That it helpeth by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and two manner of ways: For Firſt, Purgation dryeth the Body, and ſo depriving the Blood of moiſture, maketh it more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to flow. Secondly, By Purging ſharp Humors, the part which ſendeth the Humor is not irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But in this caſe, lenitives are better than eradicatives, becauſe they rather cool than heat, and cauſe no ebullition in the Humors: ſuch are <hi>Diacatholicum, Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium lenitivum, Electuarium de ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſten,</hi> or a Bole, or <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds and Sugar of Violets.</p>
                     <p>As for the Topical means, which reſpect the Part and the Humor, they are of three ſorts: <hi>Revellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Defenſiva</hi> or <hi>Intercipientia,</hi> and <hi>Repellentia:</hi> now Medicaments appointed for Revulſion, muſt be hot and attractive, and applyed to the parts oppoſite and remote, as I have ſet down in the general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing of Tumors. Of this kind are Fomentations, made of all ſweet Smelling and hot Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Herbs boiled in ſtrong Wine, as Calaminth, Penniroyal, Mints, Lavander, Tanſie, Time, Smallage, Feverfew, Sage, Savory, Pellitory of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Fomentation muſt be very hot, the uſe of them muſt be continued until the part become Red. Sometimes, if the affluxion of the Humor be fierce, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, we are to apply Veſicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as in Inflammations of the Eyes to the Neck: but ſeeing there is none who is but initiated in the practice of Chirurgery, who is not fitted with a Medicament for this purpoſe, I mean not to miſpend Time in ſetting down any deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of them. But let me tell you, that ſome forts of <hi>Ranun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> or Crow-foot green beaten and applied to the Part, are more ſecure than <hi>Cantharides;</hi> but the Bull-foot, which is found in moſt Pools by the High-way, is moſt excellent, being beaten, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a Walnut-ſhell, or Muſcle, or Cockle-ſhels, chooſing the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſs of the Shels, according to your purpoſe. If in the Winter time you apply <hi>Cantharides,</hi> you muſt correct them with <hi>Eupher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> Muſtard-feed, and Seeds of <hi>Ammi,</hi> or Dill; for if a Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of them be applied to thin and tender Bodies, it will cauſe difficulty of Urine, which will be removed ſpeedily, if the Party drink of an Almond-Milk, made of Barley-water, wherewith the emulſion of the great cold Seeds hath been drawn, and that warm. Beſides theſe local Medicaments, we are to uſe Cupping-glaſſes, ſometimes without ſcarification, if the Party be timorous, and not very Plethorick; but if the affluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humor be great, and the Party ſtrong and couragious, let ſcarification be uſed. Frictions alſo are not to be omitted; but in this exerciſe we muſt begin at the Extremities, as Hands and Feet, and end at the Trunk of the Body, to move the Humor, and then to labour again from the Trunk to the Extremities, to bring it downwards.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52816:30"/>
                     <p>As for Ligatures, in applying them you muſt begin at the Trunk, as about the Shoulder, and articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Thigh, and end in the Hands and Feet, making three Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures in each Extremity; above the Elbow, and about the Wriſt in the Arm, and above the Knee and Ankle in the Leg.</p>
                     <p>After revelling means, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives ſucceed. Theſe are applied to ſtay the Humor from flowing to the Part, theſe muſt be cold, dry, and aſtringent, ſit to purſe in and contract the Veſſels. Theſe are applied to the parts adjacent, and which have leſs Fleſh, as to the Joynts, and parts above the Joynts; for there the Veſſels are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and ſo are moſt apt to receive the impreſſion of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament: ſo if the Foot or Hand be inflamed, let the Defenſives be applied to the Wriſt, and ſo forth.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe Defenſives there be two ſorts; for ſome are more mild, as Plantain, the White Roſe, Night-ſhade, Red Poppy, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Spawn of Frogs, Red Wine, Vinegar and Water, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Oyl beaten together, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oxelaeum,</hi> Verjuice, and ſuch like, and theſe are to be applyed to tender Bodies, and who have but ſmall Veins. Others are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as Bole, <hi>Sanguis draconis, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſigillata,</hi> Pomegranate-Flowers and Rinds, the Decoction and Pulp of Sloes, <hi>Sumach,</hi> Myrtle-Berries. Theſe are to be applyed to Bodies of a ſtrong Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ripe age, and who have large Veins, and in the Summer time, and when the Inflammation is fierce. Of ſuch Simples we may make Compoſitions fitting our purpoſe: as mingling Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Bole with the Oyl of Myrtles, and Whites of Eggs: The juyce of Houſleek with Milk is good, or a Decoction made of Red Wine and Tanners Wooſe, wherein are boiled Red Roſe Leaves, Myrtle-berries, <hi>Sumach,</hi> and Pomgranate Pills and Rinds: <hi>Ceratum Santalinum</hi> is good. It is not amiſs to have in readineſs, ſuch a Defenſive as this, Take of White Wax Ten Ounces, of the Oyl of Myrtles, and Quinces of each one Ounce, of Maſtick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij of Bole, and <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi> beat to Powder, of each j Ounce and two Drams, make up an Emplaſter: in the Winter you may add more Oyl.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all <hi>Repellentia</hi> offer themſelves, which beat back from the part affected, the Humor: The differences of ſuch Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, taken from their Subſtance are theſe. Some are cold and moiſt, as Houſleek, Lettuce, Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Succory, Ducks-Meat, the White of an Egg, Navelwort, Night-ſhade. Theſe are mild, you may uſe either the juyce of theſe, or a Cataplaſm made of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-meal, and theſe Juyces. There be ſome Simples which more ſtrongly cool, as the Henbane, Mandrake, Hemlock, the deadly Night-ſhade, and the Apple of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru:</hi> but theſe are only to be uſed, when the Party is of a flouriſhing age, in the Summer, and the Veins large.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſome of theſe repelling Medicaments are aſtringent, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drying: theſe repell more ſtrongly than the cold and moiſt, for beſides cooling, whereby the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52816:30"/>natural heat flying its contrary, doth carry with it the Blood; they draw together the part, and as it were wring out the Humor: of theſe ſome are weaker, as Vine-Leaves, Plantain, Horſe-tall, Perl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkle, Bulls of Red Roſes; Oyl of Myrtles: others are ſtronger, as Bole, Pomegranate Pills and Rinds, the Pulp of Sloes, Oaken and Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bark, Red Wine with Alum, Galls, the husks of Green Nuts: Theſe if they be untimely uſed, wrinkle the Skin, increaſe the pain, indurate the Humor in the Part, and ſometimes return the Matter to ſome principal part.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if we will uſe aright the Simples, and make good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of them, we muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider the temperature of the Party and Part, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Inflammation, the quantity of the Humor flowing, the Senſe of the Part, the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Air. Wherefore the hot Conſtitution of the Party and Part require gentler Topicks, becauſe the exceſs is not great, only Heat being added to Heat; but if the Part be cold, and leſs fleſhy, it requireth ſtronger Medicaments; becauſe the Cauſe muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So in Children and Women we uſe milder than in aged and ſtrong Bodies: So the greater the Inflammation is, the ſtronger ought the Topick to be: So if the Part be very ſenſible, gentle means will ſerve, but if it be dull it will ſuffer ſtronger; ſo if the Veins be large, ſtronger Medicaments are to be applyed, becauſe plenty of Blood muſt needs flow. Laſt of all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of the Air, the local means muſt be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or weaker.</p>
                     <p>Now it is time to determine, what Medicaments are to be uſed in the beginning of a Phlegmon: If therefore the Party be offered while the Blood is wholly yet in the ſmall Veins, then repelling Medicaments are to be applyed. 1. Becauſe the Humor as yet is but little and thin. 2. Becauſe Nature as yet is ſtrong. 3. Becauſe the Matter is not as yet ſetled or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted; If ſome of the Humor be in the ſmall Veins, and ſome be without them in the diſtances of the Muſcles, and Parts, or in the Poroſities of the ſimilar Parts, we are to apply Medicaments part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelling, partly diſcuſſing, but more of the repelling.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, in caſes repelling, Medicaments are not to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Phlegmons beginning. 1. If the Parts be weak, leſt their Natural Heat be quenched; ſuch are Glandulous parts, for they are looſe and flaggy. 2. When there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pain; for then repelling Medicaments would cauſe greater pain, and ſo perhaps cauſe Fainting and Swouning. 3. When the Cauſe is External, and cauſeth the Malignity, as the biting of a Mad Dog, or of an Adder; for ſo the Matter ſhould be driven to the principal Parts. 4. When the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vehement, and much Matter floweth; for then repelling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments ſhould be fruitleſs; the Part not being able to reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing I have ſet down both the Simples, and ſome forms of compound Medicaments of the Two kinds of Topicks, I will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all idle repetition, and paſs to the <hi>Augmentum,</hi> or increaſe of a Phlegmon. In it then we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52816:31"/>are to apply diſcuſſing Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mingled with repelling, yet the repelling during the whole courſe of the <hi>Augmentum,</hi> ought to have the Dominion; becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the latt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r end of the increaſe, the greateſt part of the Matter is within the Veſſels, and may be repelled; for when Blood is once ſlipt out of the Veins, it cannot be evacuated by repelling, but by diſcuſſing Topicks: Theſe are called alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. They ought to be hot and dry in the Third Degree, and of a piercing ſubſtance: For Firſt, they muſt make the Blood thin and fluxible: Secondly, They muſt convert it into Vapors; And Thirdly, They muſt evacuate by the Pores of the Skin, by inſenſible Perſpiration. In thin and tender Bodies in the Summer time, mild Medicaments are moſt convenient, as Chamomil, Dill, Fenugreek, Bean-Flour, and ſuch like. But in compact, and thick Bodies, ſtrong are required, as, <hi>Sulphur vivum, Opopanax, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum,</hi> Mints, Horehound, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Calamint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Phlegmon is come to the ſtate, or height of pain, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Heat, Medicaments equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelling, and diſcuſſing are to be applied; becauſe a great deal of the Humor is yet in the Veins, and much without them.</p>
                     <p>When a Phlegmon is come to the Declination wherein Tenſion, and Heat begin to abate, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutient Fomentation, made of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil Leaves and Flowers, Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, Dill; Tanlie, Sage, Lavander, Mints, <hi>Scordium,</hi> and ſuch like, and the application of <hi>Diachylon cum gummi</hi> will ſerve, or a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Bean-flour, Chamomil, Dill, Melilot boiled in ſtrong Ale-Lees, adding to the Cataplaſm, Oil of Chamomil, Dill, and White Lilies; but if the Inflammation be great, the Pain vehement, the Heat into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; if there be Tenſion and Swelling, notwithſtanding the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the former courſe, then Suppuration or Apoſtemation is to be procured.</p>
                     <p>If the natural Heat in the Body of Man be prevalent, it turneth all things to nouriſhment, that are familiar to Nature; if any Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious part be in them, it turneth that into Vapors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth them by inſenſible Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if the natural Heat be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to encounter the unnatural Heat upon equal terms, then the natural Heat diſcuſſeth ſome part, and the unnatural Heat not able to corrupt the Part, ſuffereth a Mean to be wrought, that is, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Quittour. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which of them the Victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, may be gathered by the qualities of the Quittour. If the Quittour be good, it is White, becauſe it is cauſed by the coats of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and Membranes, which are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour White, and tranſmute the Matter into the ſame colour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thick, becauſe Concoction is performed by thickning. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Uniform, becauſe the natural Heat hath an abſolute Dominion over every part of the Quittour. Fourthly, Not ſtinking, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat induring no putrefaction: If contrariwiſe the Quittour be pale, red, or black, thin, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, of divers ſubſtances, and ſtinking; then the unnatural Heat
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52816:31"/>is prevalent. Now how a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which muſt be Suppurate is to be dreſſed, I have ſet down at large in the former Chapter of Apoſtumations of hot Tumors.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe Examples are the moſt effectual Inſtructers, I will give you one out of <hi>Hildanus</hi> his <hi>Ob. Chir. Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Ob.</hi> 100.
<q>A Gentleman's Servant, a young Man, after over-violent walking, was troubled with a pain in his Foot, and not minding it in the beginning, the pain increaſed, and an Inflammation enſued. I was called, and found his Foot all ſwelled, and ſeized with a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The pain was great, and reached to the Hips, he was in a continual burning Fever, he was reſtleſs, delirous, and fainted away ſometimes; I ordered his Cure in this manner. I preſcribed him a ſpare Diet, and purged him with the following Potion. ℞ <hi>Elect. de ſucco roſar. Pulv. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavanti cum Rhabarb. ℈jſs.

Wherefore the next day I took away Ten Ounces of Blood from the Arm of the Side affected, (for he was Plethorick and ſtrong). Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fever, Pain, and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation abated much; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after I anointed his Hip, Knee, and all thereabout, that was free from Inflammation, with the following Liniment ℞ <hi>Ol. roſ.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Ol.

And becauſe the Sole of the Foot is very callous, I dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently fomented it with hot Milk, wherein Fenugreek Seeds, and Mallows, and Violet-Leaves were boiled. Then I ſhaved off the Calloſity with a Razor, as I have written, <hi>Obſ.</hi> 97. <hi>Cent.</hi> 7. in the Cure of a Whitlow. Thus in a ſhort time the Apoſteme broke in the Sole of his Foot, and he recovered. While I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Cure, his Miſtreſs told me, that a Kinſman of his died in a few days of the like Diſeaſe. which need not ſeem ſtrange to any Man. For the Part being Nervous, and endued with a moſt exquiſite Senſe, it muſt needs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion moſt grievous Symptomes.</q>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in our Vulgar Speech, and with the Barbarous late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is taken for the Humor it ſelf; and ſo I ſhall be inforced to uſe it. Thus much I thought fit to inſinuate to you, that you ſhould not be ignorant of the proper and learned ſignifications of the terms of Art.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Bilis</hi> or <hi>Fel</hi> in Latin, <gap reason="foreign">

I. Is the Vitelline, like unto the Yolks of Eggs yellow; but thicker and hotter than that of the Gall. II. Is <hi>Porracea,</hi> which in colour repreſenteth the Leek, it is engrendred in the Stomach by reaſon of Crudity, and eating of ſuch Meats as engender it: as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Onyons, Leeks, and Milk in Infants, who often by Stool diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſuch an Humor.

                     <p>An <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> then <hi>is a hot Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor proceeding moſt from Choler.</hi> In this Deſcription Tumor is the <hi>Genus:</hi> for this is common to an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> with all other Tumors. In that it is ſaid to be hot, it differeth from <hi>Oedema</hi> and Scirrhus: And whereas it is affirmed to proceed of moſt Choler, it is diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of the Tumors.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be demanded, whether an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be cauſed of Alimentary, or of ſuperfluous Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. I anſwer, that it is to be thought that it is cauſed of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Choler, if it be exquiſite: otherwiſe how could the yellow Jaundiſe and an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſo much differ, if they both did proceed from excrementitious Choler? For firſt, the yellow Jaundiſe poſſeſſeth the Skin of the whole Body, but an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> one part only Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> hath always a ſymptomatical Fever annexed to it; but the yellow Jaundiſe is moſt commonly free from it. Thirdly, in an <hi>Eryſiypelas</hi> there is always pain, but in the Jaundiſe none. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Jaundiſe the Skin is of a yellowiſh colour, but in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſipelas</hi> it is of a bright red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>There are two kinds of <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> for it is either exquiſite or not exquiſite, or a true, and a baſtard one: As for an exquiſite <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> it is a Tumor of a bright Red tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Yellow, cauſing little ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, very hot, with a pricking pain, cauſed of alimentary Choler: this Choler abounding in the Body, if part of it be turned into any part, it cauſeth an exquiſite <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi> The parts which it moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly invadeth, are the Noſe and Face, for much thin Blood floweth to theſe parts. Secondly, the Legs: for Nature being moved by the plenty of this Choler, ſendeth it firſt to the Emunctories of the Groins, and from thence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth to the Legs; it happeneth in the Summer, becauſe then Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is multiplied; but in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the Pores of the Skin are ſhut by Cold, and ſo inſenſible perſpiration hindred; and becauſe this Humor is thin, it ſpreadeth to a great part of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>As for the Signs of an exquiſite <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> they are either taken from the Qualities of the Humor which cauſeth it, or from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between it and a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The Signs taken from the Qualities of the Humor are theſe: The Pain is great and urgent, the Heat notable, the Colour a bright red tending to a yellowneſs, the Tumor is ſmall, only poſſeſſing the Skin, the Pulſation is very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52816:33"/>ſmall, and leſs than in a Phlegmon, Firſt, becauſe the Parts in a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are more compreſſed: and it reacheth deeper. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a Phlegmon the Humor is thicker, and cannot ſo eaſily be breathed out as in <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> The differences between a Phlegmon and an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> are theſe. I. A Phlegmon poſſeſſeth the Skin, and the Fleſh lying under; but an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſipelas</hi> the Skin only: the cauſe in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is the thinneſs of the Humor, which rather diſperſeth it ſelf through the Skin than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it up. II. The Heat in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is greater than in a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: for ſometimes the <hi>Cuticula</hi> is bliſtered. III. The ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fever is greater in an <hi>Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas</hi> than in a Phlegmon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Choler is hotter than Blood. IV. The pain in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is leſs than in a Phlegmon: becauſe in it there is only a hot Diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; but in this a Solution of Unity, beſides the Parts being ſtretched. V. In a Phlegmon, the Colour is of a dark red by reaſon of thick Blood lying deep; but in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> the Colour is a brighter Red, tending to a Yellowneſs. VI. In an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> there is a pricking pain, but in a Phlegmon a heavy and ſtretching one. VII. The Skin in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed yieldeth, but in a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it doth not: The Cauſes are the thinneſs and thickneſs of the Humor. VIII. In an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> the redneſs vaniſheth away from the Skin, and it becomes white, if it be preſſed with the Finger, but in a Phlegmon it doth not ſo. IX. In an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> there is no ſtretching of the Skin, but in a Phlegmon there is. Laſt of all, a Phlegmon ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelf in one place; but an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> maketh the parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent red by ſpreading.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of an <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> I. That which proceeds from natural yellow Choler is mildeſt: for no vehement Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſucceed: and beſides, ſeeing it appears in the outward parts, it is to be thought that the inner parts are diſcharged of this Humor. II. As it is a good ſign, if an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> be driven to the outward parts; ſo it is fearful, if it return from the outward to the inward parts, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 25. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. III. An <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> appearing in the Head is more dangerous, than in other parts: becauſe if the Matter paſs to the <hi>Meninges,</hi> it cauſeth <hi>Phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitis</hi> or Raving; if to the Muſcles of the Neck, the Quinſie. IV. An <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> appearing in Wounds, Ulcers, Fractures, and Diſlocations, is commonly Mortal; if it proceed not from the Application of too hot local Medicines. V. If an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> tend to Suppuration, it is not good: for then the Humor muſt be thicker than ordinary, and the Obſtructions ſtronger, and ſo the ſolid Parts are in danger to be corrupted. VI. If a Bone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare, the adjacent fleſhy parts be poſſeſſed with an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> it is ill: For firſt, the Body muſt be troubled with ſharp Humors: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Fleſh cannot be reſtored by ſuch Blood.</p>
                     <p>There are four kinds of helps, Dyet, Chirurgery, internal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, and local Means. As for the Dyet, our nouriſhment muſt be cooling and moiſtning. Let the Patient then eat thin Chicken
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52816:34"/>broths, altered with cooling Herbs, Panadoes, thin Oat-meal Gruel, Sallets of Lettuce, Sorel, Purſelain, and Spinage boiled. If the Choler be very thin, the party may eat freſh Fiſh, which live in clear ſandy or rocky Waters, as Trouts, ſmall Pickrels, Perches, and of Sea-fiſhes the Whiting-maps, and Smelts; he may eat alſo of the Brain of a Pig or its Petitoes, or Trotters with Vinegar and Sorel; let him refrain from all Meats which are fat and ſweet. Let his drink be Spring-water, boiled with the bottom of a Loaf, made plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with ſome <hi>Oxyſaccharum,</hi> or the diſtilled Waters of Endive or Sorel; he may uſe a plain Ptiſan. <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>met. c.</hi> 5. permits the Patient to drink as much cold Water as he will, for this cools the Body, quenches Thirſt, abates the heat of Choler, and cooleth the Liver: but in this caſe the Seaſon muſt be hot, and the Stomach good: with us Small-beer botled is beſt, all ſorts of Wine are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. In the Summer, let the Air be cool and moiſt, in Winter, let it be rather hot: for in this Seaſon an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is cauſed of the conſtriction of the Pores of the Skin, by reaſon of cold: let all perturbations of the Mind be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, let ſleep be procured; for watching drieth the Body. But if an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be in the Face, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is beſt: for immoderate and long ſleep fills the Head full of Vapors, whereby the Grief is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Chirurgical helps, it may be doubted whether Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy be neceſſary or no: for the deciſion of this doubt, theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions ſhall ſerve: I. If an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> invade the Head, Neck or Face, the <hi>Cephalica</hi> always is to be opened: leſt a <hi>Phrenitis</hi> or <hi>Angina</hi> enſue. II. In an <hi>Eryſipelas Phlegmonodes,</hi> wherein Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the heat, in what part of the Body ſoever it be, a Vein is to be opened. III. In an exquiſite <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> in other parts of the Body we ought not to let Blood: For firſt, by letting of Blood, the Blood which remains moveth more, and becomes more ſubtil: Secondly, the qualifier of Choler is taken away: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by taking away both good and bad Blood together, the party is weakned.</p>
                     <p>As for the internal Medicaments, they ought always to go before the local, if you except two Caſes: I. If an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be procured by an outward Cauſe, as a Blow: II. If the Heat be vehement, and the Tumor be far from any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part. In theſe Caſes we may apply ſomething cooling and moiſtning, before we give any purging Medicament. If an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> appear in the Head or Face, we muſt open a Vein, apply Leeches, give a purging Medicament, preſcribe a ſlender Dyet, and uſe Revulſions by Frictions, Ventoſes, Bliſterings, and Vomiting if it appear in the Legs.</p>
                     <p>As for local Medicaments, we muſt look about us, for if we apply cold Medicaments, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be repelled to the Brain, from whence a <hi>Phrenitis</hi> may proceed, or to the Throat, which may cauſe an <hi>Angina:</hi> If you be inforced by the importunity of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52816:34"/>Patient, or ſtanders by to apply a local Medicament; <hi>Aëtius</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth to apply a Swallows neſt beat to powder, and tempered with Hony, that it may repreſent a Liniment with a Feather. This is a ſafe Medicament, for it only drieth and repelleth not: We may alſo apply the Decoction of Mallows with ſome Oyl of Violets, or ſweet Almonds. Now the purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments which diſcharge Choler, theſe or ſuch like will ſuffice, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, Tamarinds, Caſſia extracted, <hi>Electuarium lenitivum, Diacatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon, Diaprunum ſolutivum, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarium de ſucco roſar. Caryoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum.</hi> If it be but a mild In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſharp Clyſters made of the decoction of cooling Herbs, with the aforeſaid Electuaries will ſerve the turn.</p>
                     <p>Having ſet down the helps taken from Dyet, Phlebotomy, and the miniſtration of internal purging Medicaments, I muſt haſten to ſet down convenient local Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments; for in theſe we are moſt imployed and buſied: one thing is to be obſerved, that we muſt not in any caſe apply aſtringent Medicaments, which are cooling and drying: For ſeeing the Vapors in this Tumor are ſharp, if they be kept in, they might erode and corrupt the part. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning local Medicaments; Firſt, I will ſet down which they are: Secondly, how long they are to be applyed. Theſe Medicaments ought to be cooling and moiſtning: but before I name them, let me warn you, that firſt you refrain from Narcotical Simples, unleſs exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great pain, and a part far from a principal part call for them. Secondly, that you apply not unctuous and fat Medicaments: For firſt, they moſt eaſily are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed: Secondly, they ſtop the Pores. Now the Medicaments which are to be imployed, are either Simple or Compound: The Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are Navel-wort, Horſe-tail, Knot-graſs, both the Plantains, Ducks meat, Garden Night-ſhade, Lettuce, Purſelain, the Poppies: Firſt, the Juyce of them expreſſed may be applied: Secondly, the diſtilled Waters drawn from them, ſome Powder of Myrrhe having been infuſed in them. We may alſo apply Clouts wet in the Juyces of the aforeſaid Herbs, being mingled with Verjuyce or Vinegar. The compound Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>Ceratum infrigidans Galeni</hi> made of <abbr>lb</abbr> j. of Oyl of Roſes, and ℥ iiij. of white Wax: this is to be waſhed with Water and Vinegar. You may add to it the Juyce of Night-ſhade. <hi>Heurnius</hi> hath three good Medicaments: The firſt is Caſtle-ſoap diſſolved in Spring-water: The ſecond, is Bulls dung boiled in a Frying-pan with Vinegar, and a few Flowers of Chamomil and Elder, until it come to the conſiſtence of a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The third is made of two parts of <hi>Aqua Spermatis rana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and one part of Roſe Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, wherein ſome Myrrhe muſt be infuſed: theſe may be ſafely applied to an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> of the Head, Neck or Face: the Juyce of Horſe-dung is not only good, being applied to this Tumor, but in Scaldings and Burnings alſo, if a little Camphor be added to it.</p>
                     <p>The Medicaments which are to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52816:35"/>be applied to an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> muſt be very liquid, actually cold, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changed; for when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hot, they will rather offend than profit, if they be not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The laſt thing which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſet down concerning the local Medicaments, was, How long they were to be applyed? This we may find out by two Signs. The Firſt is, If the Heat be altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, or almoſt: The Second is, if the Skin hath recovered its own colour. When you perceive theſe two Signs, you muſt deſiſt from applying cooling Topicks, leſt the Skin become livid, or black, which threaten a Gangreen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Mortification. If this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, What then is to be done? Firſt, a Fomentation is to be uſed, made of Calamint, <hi>Scordium,</hi> Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Peniroyal, the leſſer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury; and Betony boiled in a weak Lie made of ordinary Aſhes: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the part is ſufficiently foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you are to apply <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Cataplaſm made of Barley-meal, Vinegar, and Oyl of Roſes warm: or this, take of the Flour of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Beans, and Vetches of each liij. ℥. of a weak Lie, iii j. <abbr>lb.</abbr> boil theſe to the conſiſtence of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter, then put to it iiij. ℥. of Oxymel. If the diſcolouring of the Part paſs through the Skin, and the part be immoderately cooled, it will not be amiſs to ſcarify the part which only remaineth.</p>

But compound Humors are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by the Doctrine of the ſimple, and the Medicaments are accordingly to be applyed.</p>
                     <p>Of that <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> which breaks the Skin, there are two kinds, <hi>Herpes miliaris,</hi> and <hi>Herpes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: Herpes miliaris</hi> is cauſed of a ſalt wateriſh Humor mingled with unnatural ſharp Choler: the ſigns of it are theſe.

                     <p>Phlegm then is the Fourth part of the maſs of Blood, Cold and Moiſt: As concerning the ſorts of it, it is either alimentary, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious. The natural as it is cold and moiſt, ſo it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52816:36"/>any forraign Taſt: as Oil and Butter are accounted Sweet, when as they have no rank taſte.

                     <p>Unnatural Phlegm is that which cannot be turned into Aliment: of it there are three kinds. The Firſt is <hi>Pituita acida,</hi> ſowre Phlegm, ſo called from the Taſt which it leaves in the Mouth, when it is ſpit out: This is a raw Phlegm, and bred in the Stomach, through defect of natural heat: ſo that being drawn into the Veins, it hardly can be altered. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, <hi>Pituita ſalſa,</hi> ſalt Phlegm, this is cauſed by the admiſtion of a thin ſalt Moiſture: For of bitter things, as Aloe, and Coloquint, mingle them with thin Humors as you will, a Salt Taſt never can be procured. In Sweat, Tears, and Urine, this Taſt is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: a very Novice in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymie is able to make the Salt of Urine. The Third kind of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or excrementitious Phlegm, is <hi>Pituita vitrea,</hi> repreſenting in colour and ſubſtance, melted Glaſs. This is very cold, thick, and tough, and cauſes great pain, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in any part. <hi>Galen</hi> affirms of himſelf; that being troubled with a vehement pain of the Belly, by injection of the Oil of Rue, he was diſcharged of ſuch an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and ſo the pain ceaſed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he thought that a Stone had ſtuck in one of the Ureters.</p>
                     <p>Phlegmatick perſons are ſlow and ſluggiſh, their Senſes dull, they are ſleepy, they dream of Waters, Rain or Snow, they are not eaſily moved to anger, their Pulſe is ſoft, ſmall and ſlow: their Appetite is not great, they are ſeldom dry, they by the Mouth and Noſe void many Phlegmatick Excrements: their Urine is White or Pale, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thick, ſometimes thin; their Stools often are raw and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: The Blood, by what means ſoever it flow from the Body, is pituitous: their Body is Whitiſh, Soft, and Coldiſh, they are ſubject to cold and long Diſeaſes, as the Dropſie, Lethargy, and ſuch like: Laſtly, they endure Faſting well. Theſe ſigns ſhew natural and ſweet Phlegm to abound in the Body.</p>

An <hi>Oedema</hi> is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or not exquiſite: an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite is either primary or ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical: The Primary is cauſed of natural Phlegm, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the maſs of Blood, and by reaſon of the too great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52816:36"/>of it, incites the expelling facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſcharge it into the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and depending parts. Natural Phlegm is cold and moiſt, thin in conſiſtence, in colour White, in Taſt Sweetiſh, or inſipid. The ſigns of an exquiſite <hi>Oedema</hi> are Five. 1. It is ſoft and looſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is cauſed of thin Phlegm. 2. If it be preſſed with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it has either no pain, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little. 3. If it be preſſed down with the Finger, it yields and leaves a pit, which is the moſt proper ſign of an <hi>Oedema.</hi> 4. It is White, repreſenting Phlegm in colour, whereof it is bred. 5. It is cold without heat, becauſe the pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Humor is cold and moiſt: <hi>Avicen</hi> calleth this Tumor <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi> The material cauſe then of this Tumor, is the pituitous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor redounding in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This Humor is cauſed either of External or Internal cauſes: the External cauſes are Air, Cold and Moiſt, Phlegmatick Meats, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, too much Sleep, ſtinging of Waſps, and ſuch like: the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal are a cold and moiſt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Head, and Stomach, but chieſly of the Liver. This Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor invades not promiſcuouſly all parts, but ſuch as are cold, weak, and looſe, ſuch are the Feet and Hands, the Cods, as in <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> the Eye-lids: and then in them appears an outward Tumor looſe, without pain, not altering the colour of them; which being preſſed with the Finger, quickly yields and returns. The material Cauſe being a wateriſh Humor mingled with Flatuoſity: So the Heart and Liver cannot ſuffer any ſuch Tumor, as neither the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, becauſe theſe parts are firm and hot. As for the Prognoſtick, an <hi>Oedema</hi> is a long continuing Diſeaſe, becauſe it is cold, and therefore the natural heat of the parts affected, muſt be weak. 2. It is not very dangerous, becauſe the pain is none or very ſmall. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cure, it is performed either by Diet, or Internal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, or local means: As for the Diet of ſuch as are ſubject to an <hi>Oedema,</hi> if it proceed from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes they muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: The Air, which is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, muſt be hot and dry, the Food muſt be drying: Wherefore roaſted Meat is better than boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Fowls and Birds which live in dry Grounds, are better than Water-Fowls; Rabbets, Chickens, and Veal are good; Mutton is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Lamb; Swines Fleſh and Fiſhes are to be ſhunned, as alſo Heads, Brains, and Feet of Beaſts: Sallets of cold Herbs are hurtful; uſe Biſcoct-Bread, or good Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold-Bread baked with Aniſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, and Coriander-ſeeds. Let the Drink be altered with the raſping of <hi>Guajacum, Sarſaparilla, Radix chinae, Saſſafras,</hi> Yellow San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Cummin-ſeeds, Coriander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, Aniſe-ſeeds, Galingal, Nutmegs, <hi>Calamus aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus,</hi> ſome Ginger, Cinamon, Roſemary and Sage. A drying Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et made of theſe, eſpecially in the Summer time is good. Sweating in this caſe is very effectual, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Morning after taking of the Diet: Faſting is good, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Watching, Studying, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring: for all theſe dry the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body.</p>
                     <p>If an <hi>Oedema</hi> poſſeſs the Hands,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52816:37"/>then walking is good; if the Feet, then we are to preſcribe ſitting and working with the hands. Seeing then an exquiſite Dyet will not ſerve to conquer this Diſeaſe alone, we are to entertain purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments for obtaining the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We need not to trouble the Patient with many preparative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, ſeeing the pituitous Humor which cauſeth this Diſeaſe is thin, wateriſh and in motion; Firſt of all, no Medicaments inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal are ſo effectual in this Grief as <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> and ſafe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments of Antimony: For firſt, they diſcharge the Stomach of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities by Vomiting, and ſo correct the cold and moiſt diſtemperature of it: Secondly, they diſpatch the obſtructions of the meſaraical Veins and Liver: Thirdly, they mightily evacuate wateriſh and phlegmatick Humors, and ſo correct the diſtemperature of the Liver and Kidnies.</p>
                     <p>As for ordinary internal Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Pilulae de hiera cum agarico,</hi> quickned with a grain of <hi>Elaterium,</hi> are good: <hi>Diaphaenicon, Diacar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamum, Diaturbith, Pilulae de Hermodactylis, de Aromatibus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae.</hi> And the Pills of <hi>Galen</hi> made of Coloquint, <hi>Aloe,</hi> and <hi>Scammonie,</hi> with <hi>Syrupus Auguſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here you may demand of me what is to be thought of Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy?</p>
                     <p>To this demand I anſwer, That in an exquiſite <hi>Oedema</hi> opening of a Vein is to be ſhunned. I. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a Body cold and moiſt we open not a Vein; ſuch is that which is tainted with an <hi>Oedema.</hi> II. Becauſe in this Grief there is always <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> ſeldom <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora:</hi> III. Becauſe in an <hi>Oedema,</hi> there is neither a malign Matter, nor a horrible Symptom, and ſo it cannot be called <hi>Morbus Magnus,</hi> or a fearful Diſeaſe: and ſo Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy is not required. As for the local Medicaments, which are to be applied, they ought by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning to alter the part.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning we are to apply ſuch Medicaments as repell, and digeſt; but more digeſting than repelling, becauſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is cold; for in the beginning ſome part of the Humor is in the ſmall Veins, ſome in the Pores of the Skin; but more in the Cavities, and greater Veins: towards the ſtate of the Grief we are to uſe digeſting means. <hi>Galen</hi> uſeth four Things. I. A Rowler with two ends, ſuch as is uſed in Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; firſt the Rowler muſt bind the Tumor it ſelf more ſtraitly; but the parts on every ſide adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent more ſlackly; for ſo the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is wrung out from the part affected, to the parts adjacent above and below. II. Is a Sponge; but in the uſe of a Sponge we muſt ſee that it cover all the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part, otherwiſe at the next dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we ſhall ſee that the Humor hath flowed to the bare part: Inſtead of a Sponge we may uſe Pledgets of Hemp-tow; yea, and double Cloaths. III. Vinegar; for it doth conſume Phlegm, and becauſe it is ſubtil it pierceth. IV. Some Water to moderate the ſharpneſs of the Vinegar: If the <hi>Oedema</hi> be above Sinews and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons in a tender Body, leſs Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is required. But in hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

                        </gap>egar is to be applied: If you min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſome Alume with Vinegar and Water, the Medicament will be the more effectual. <hi>Avicen</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth to apply Lime-water with the Juyce of Myrtles: but inſtead of the Juyce we may boil Myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries in Lime-water.</p>
                     <p>If you boil <hi>Scordium,</hi> Myrtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that the Oedematous part is to be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed well with a Cloth before the Medicaments be applied, that they may penetrate more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>If an <hi>Oedema</hi> in the Belly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> after 60 days tend to Suppuration (which cometh to paſs becauſe the Phlegm by long ſtaying in the part, is altered by heat, and turned to Quittour) then we are to haſten Suppuration by the Application of <hi>Diachylon cum gummi.</hi> Then to open it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to mundifie it. Fourthly, to incarnate it. And laſt of all to procure skinning.</p>

                        <hi>Hildanus Obſ.</hi> 91. <hi>Cent.</hi> 6. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates a ſtrange Hiſtory of a Woman, who from her Childhood was troubled with an aedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, but hard, in her right Hand, which yet did not hinder the uſe of it, and ſhe was otherwiſe very well in Health. Several things had been uſed, but without ſucceſs. At laſt it was reſolved to leave it to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And about the thirteenth year of her Age, when her Friends never dreamt of Cure, it began to decreaſe of it ſelf; ſo that in few days it was quite gone. But the Phyſician predicted ſome ill Event, and ſo it proved. For it fell into her Shoulder and tormented her moſt grievouſly. By uſing proper means ſhe ſeemed cured; but in a little time it fell into her right Hip, and there tormented her again; till at length the Head of her Thigh-bone ſlipt outwards, which made one Leg ſhorter than the other, which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited. Afterwards, when all was thought to have been over, a pain fell into her right Foot, eſpecially about the Heel, with a great Inflammation, which required a new courſe. She was Purged, took Apozems, Juleps and Sudorificks, had Topical Anodynes, moderately repelling applied at firſt, and then things to cauſe <hi>Pus.</hi> At laſt the Abſceſs broke in her Heel, out of which there ran a great deal of Matter. In a few days a piece of Bone like a Fiſhes Scale came away; when it was got out, ſhe was cured; only ſhe halted a little.</p>
                     <p>It falls out many times that an <hi>Oedema,</hi> is a ſymptom of another Diſeaſe, as I have ſaid: but chiefly of the Cough of the Lungs, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or <hi>Cachexia,</hi> or ill habit of the Body, and doth poſſeſs the Legs and Hands: Firſt, becauſe they are fartheſt from the Heart, the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of heat: Secondly, becauſe they are framed of cold parts; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Accident cannot be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52816:38"/>unleſs the Diſeaſe which is the cauſe of it be cured, and ſeeing theſe Diſeaſes are for the moſt part mortal, I will ſuffer ſuch as are Empiricks, and prodigal of their own Credits, to follow their own courſes, and to undertake ſuch Cures.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Oedema</hi> is thus engendred: when Nature is troubled with Phlegm, the expelling faculty thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pituitous Humor from the great Veſſels to the leſſer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in by the denſity and coldneſs of the Skin, is gathered in the Muſculous part, and ſo cauſes this Tumor. Hitherto I have diſcourſed of an exquiſite <hi>Oedema.</hi> Now it remaineth that I briefly diſpatch that <hi>Oedema</hi> which is not exquiſite. This is cauſed when ſome other Humor is joyned with the pituitous: if Blood then be joyned with it, it cauſes <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>. In all theſe kinds of a not exquiſite <hi>Oedema,</hi> the thin pituitous Tumor muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. The other Humors concurring are found out by their own proper Signs, which are ſet down in the diſcourſes of every principal Tumor, ſo that I ſhould miſpend time, if I ſhould go about to ſet them down here. Some things I would have you to note. The firſt is, a primary <hi>Oedema</hi> is cauſed by congeſtion; for it creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on by degrees: But that which is Symptomatical, an Accident of other Diſeaſes, as <hi>Tabes, Aſthma, Cachexia</hi> and Dropſie, is procured by Fluxion: for it ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. The ſecond is this: li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by reaſon of long keeping bed, either becauſe one hath had a long and lingring Diſeaſe, or becauſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hath received a hurt in the Leg, the Feet ſwell and become Oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous: When by motion afterward the Natural Heat is increaſed, this flatulent Phlegm is diſcuſſed and the Tumor ceaſeth. But it is time to ſet down thoſe Tumors which are referred to an <hi>Oedema:</hi> of thoſe ſome are encloſed within a <hi>Cyſtis</hi> or a Membrane; and ſome have no proper Membrane: thoſe which have a proper Membrane are in number. 3. <hi>Atheroma, Steatoma,</hi> and <hi>Meliceris.</hi> But it may be doubted from whence this <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> Membrane, or <hi>Folliculus</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: Undoubtedly it is framed of the tyes of the <hi>Cutis</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Carnoſa:</hi> for ſeeing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat cannot concoct the Matter of theſe Abſceſſes, Nature doth providently ſeparate it by its proper <hi>Cyſtis</hi> from the parts adjacent, leſt it ſhould corrupt them.</p>
                     <p>The Matter which cauſes theſe Abſceſſes and feeds them, proceeds from a Vein, which is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an Artery; and ſo being deſtitute of Vital Heat, it is altogether unnatural, and cannot be aſſimilate to the parts unto which it floweth. <hi>Atheroma</hi> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Steatoma</hi> is a Tumor not ſo high as <hi>Atheroma,</hi> containing a Matter like unto Greaſe, or that which we call the Sweet-bread, <hi>Pancreas:</hi> Blood flowing by the Vein which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52816:38"/>hath no Artery, and ſo is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Vital Heat, is eaſily turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into this fatty ſubſtance. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liceris</hi> contains a Matter repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Hony: ſo the Phlegm which cauſes this Tumor is thinner than that which breeds an <hi>Athero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and hath ſome Choler min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it, the heat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh the Matter fluid and liquid.</p>
                     <p>The Tumors reducible to an <hi>Oedema</hi> which have no <hi>Cyſtis</hi> are three, <hi>Pſydracium, Ficus</hi> and <hi>Talpa, Pſydracium</hi> is a pointed white Puſtule containing in it a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Humidity. <hi>Ficus</hi> is a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſo called; Firſt, becauſe it has a Root like unto a Fig; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe it contains ſmall grains as a Fig hath. It is a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor red, round, and ſomewhat hard and painful; from whence iſſueth a Matter, like unto the ſeeds of a Fig, if it be broken and wrung. The Matter of this Tumor is groſs Blood, mingled with Phlegm and ſome wateriſh moiſture. <hi>Talpa</hi> or <hi>Teſtudo</hi> is ſo called, becauſe as a Mole heaves up the Ground, ſo this Tumor lifts the Skin from the <hi>Peric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So you have a brief deſcription of the Tumors which are reducible to an <hi>Oedema:</hi> As for the cure of them, I will reſerve it until I come to that part of Chirurgery called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Ganglium</hi> and <hi>Lupia</hi> are round Tumors of the Nervous Parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain: yet they differ; for <hi>Gangli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is hard but <hi>Lupia</hi> ſoft: Secondly, <hi>Lupia</hi> may be moved every way, upward, downward, and ſide ways: but <hi>Ganglium</hi> toward the ſides only.

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw are we to enter into the contemplation of a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> the ugly progeny of muddy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, as we have diſcourſed of a <hi>Phlegmon, Eryſipelas</hi> and <hi>Oedema,</hi> who deduce their Pedigree from Blood, Choler, and Phlegm, and aſcribe their being to them. But that you may hereafter diſcern the better the nature of a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> I will firſt ſet down the deſcription of Melancholy: Secondly, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of it: And thirdly, the proper ſigns of a Melancholick Perſon: which will both lead you to the knowledge of the Grief, and open the way of curing the perſon poſſeſſed with this Grief. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Engliſh Tongue doth promiſcuouſly uſe Melancholy, both for <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Atra Bilis,</hi> I muſt give you warning, that theſe two do much differ; for <hi>Melancholicus Succus</hi> is the feculent part of the Blood, like unto the Lees of thick Wines, as Allegant. It is one of the four nutritive Humors natural to the Body, and gentle, having no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive or ſtinking quality. But <hi>Bilis Atra</hi> is cauſed of immoderate Heat, and is Malign, for it burns and corrupts the Fleſh, it is ſowre and ſharp, and being poured upon the ground, it boileth and raiſeth it up, as Leaven doth Dough, and hath an unpleaſant ſmell. There be three ſorts of this: The firſt is cauſed of Blood burned, and of all others is the mildeſt: The ſecond is ingendred of <hi>Succus Melancholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> burned; and it differs as much from the natural Black, as Lees burned from the unburned: The third is cauſed of yellow or vitellin Choler more burned, which of all others is the worſt; becauſe Choler, whereof it is bred, is more hot and ſharp than melancholick Juyce.</p>
                     <p>None of theſe are engendred in a ſound and healthful perſon, whereas the <hi>Succus Melancholicus</hi> is found in all perſons of what temperature or ſtate ſoever they be. Wherefore <hi>Melancholicus Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> may be thus deſcribed: It is the fourth Humor in the Maſs of Blood, black and thick, yet natural cold and dry. This Humor natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is either Alimentary or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious. The Alimentary nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the Melancholick Parts, which are cold and dry, as the Bones, Cartilages, and Ligaments. The excrementitious or ſuperfluous is drawn by the Spleen.</p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52816:39"/>
                     <p>Now theſe ſigns diſcover Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Perſons; they are ſilent, penſive, conſtant in their purpoſes, ſlow to Anger; but if they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, they turn it unto Hatred: Their Sleep is troubleſome by reaſon of fearful Dreams, as of black Things, dead Bodies, Death, they are ſad, and given to fear without cauſe; their Pulſe is ſmall, ſlow and hard: their Colour is dark, their Appetite to Meat and <hi>Venus</hi> is more than ordinary: they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thirſt, becauſe they abound with much ſuperfluous Phlegm, their Blood is thicker and blacker than ordinary, from what part ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the Body it flow, the Urine is thin and white, if no Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be mingled with it; but if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy be mingled, then it is thick, black, or of a leaden colour; they Sweat much in their Sleep; the habit of their Body is lean, tough and hard: they are ſubject to <hi>Varices</hi> and Hemorrhoids: If ſuch a one be preſented to you poſſeſſed with a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> it is eaſie to diſcern the Diſeaſe, and of what Humor it proceeds, and how the party is to be dealt withal. In my Diſcourſe of a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> I will ſet down firſt the Deſcription of a <hi>Scirrhus:</hi> Secondly, the Signs of it: Thirdly, the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and other Tumors: Fourthly, the Kinds of it: Fifthly, the Prognoſticks of it: And laſtly, the manner of curing it.</p>
                     <p>To begin then with the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Scirrhus, it is a Tumor hard, and without pain, cauſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of natural Melancholy, or thick, tough and cold Phlegm.</hi> If the Cauſe be Melancholy, it hath a leaden colour; if Phlegm, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not the colour of the Skin: for Phlegm is white; As for the Signs of it; I. It is hard.</p>
                     <p>Now there are four Cauſes of hardneſs: The firſt is coldneſs, as appeareth in Ice; This is removed by moderate Heat, as by the Sun. The ſecond Cauſe, is Drineſs, as we may plainly ſee in the hands of Sailers and Felt-makers. The third Cauſe, too great Repletion, which doth appear in the Stomachs of Gluttons. The fourth Cauſe, may be the Combination of theſe, and indeed all theſe concur to procure hardneſs in a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> As for Coldneſs, it may be induced either by things external, as cold Air, and narcotical Medicaments: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the part affected, for Scirrhoſitles chiefly appear in the beginnings of the Muſcles, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments and Tendons, and other cold Parts: Thirdly, from the Humor; ſo the melancholick Juyce, and thick, and viſcous Phlegm, the material cauſes of a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> are very cold.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſign of a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is, that it is without pain; and this comes to paſs, either becauſe the animal Spirits, cannot paſs through an Humor ſo thick and glutinous as that which cauſes a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> or becauſe it is benummed by the coldneſs of the Humor. This is the third Sign that it is fixt, and as it were nailed to the part, and doth not move by puſhing, as <hi>Scrophula,</hi> or <hi>Ganglium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I will ſhew how it differs from other Tumors. It differs from a <hi>Phlegmon;</hi> for in this, there is great pain; from an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is not hard; from an <hi>Oedema,</hi> becauſe this yieldeth to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52816:40"/>the touch, and leaveth a pit. It is diſcerned from wateriſh and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Tumors, becauſe they have a thinner, and more clear Matter. The differences betweeen it and a <hi>Cancer</hi> are theſe. I. A <hi>Cancer</hi> is always painful, becauſe it is cauſed of <hi>Bilis A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ra,</hi> or aduſt Choler; but a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is without pain. II. A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is cold, but a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> hot; this is cauſed by reaſon of the Humors whereof they are bred. III. A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> invades the ſolid and hard parts, as the Joynts, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Ligaments; but a <hi>Cancer</hi> the looſe and ſlaggy parts, as the Breaſts, the Privy parts, and ſuch like. IV. In a <hi>Cancer,</hi> not in a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> the Veins appear full of a black Humor: which for the likeneſs, one may call the Legs of the Crab, as the round Tumor the Crab it ſelf. It is good to ſet down the predictions of the ſucceſs of curing, which Scirrhoſities are like to have, that when ſuch Tumors are offered to you to be cured, you may be made circumſpect and wary in taking of them in hand. An exquiſite <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is uncurable; for ſeeing it is ſenſeleſs, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the part is deprived of the influence of the Animal Spirits; and ſeeing this Humor doth diſtend the Sinews, Veins and Arteries, the Faculty it ſelf is ſtrangled and choaked, ſo that it neither can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, nor help the Natural Heat to concur with the means, to be applied for the diſpatching of this Grief. Secondly, this being a cold Tumor, and the Natural Heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weak, what hope can there be, that it can at any time tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over ſo great an Infirmity? A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> not exquiſite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not mortal, unleſs it be very great, yet it hardly admits any Cure, and by much difficulty. A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> which is extream hard is altogether uncurable: for gentle means avail nothing, and thoſe which are ſtrong make it more hard: A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> from <hi>Succus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicus</hi> is warily to be dealt withal: becauſe it has a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with a <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ſo may degenerate into it, if improper Medicaments be applied. If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be cauſed of thick and glutinous Phlegm, you may be the more bold: for this cannot eaſily contract any Malignity. The differences and divers ſorts of a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> are theſe: A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> then is either Primary, or Epigene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical. A primary <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is that, which is a Grief of it ſelf, and not cauſed by reaſon of any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity preceding. This is twofold, for it is either exquiſite, or not exquiſite: a primary exquiſite <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> is that which at the firſt, is cauſed by collection of the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Juyce in a part. A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is thought to be not exquiſite, when another Humor is joyned with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. If therefore ſome lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Blood be joyned with it, it cauſeth <hi>Scirrhus Phlegmonoides;</hi> if Choler, <hi>Scirrhus Eryſipelatodes:</hi> if Phlegm, <hi>Scirrhus Oedematodes.</hi> But theſe are compound Tumors, and are to be dealt withal accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſimple Tumors, whereof they are bred.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Scirrhus</hi> Epigenematical or Symptomatical, is that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues after another Tumor, not handled according to Art, as a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> or an <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52816:40"/>happens two manner of ways. I. It may fall out by the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate uſe of local Medicaments too cold, and narcotic or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefactive: for theſe condenſe, and as it were congeal the Humor. Secondly, this may happen by the too continual application of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive Topicks: for ſo only the ſubtil and thin parts are breathed out, and the thick and glutinous remain.</p>
                     <p>The Indications of Cure are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from three things, to wit the Dyet, internal Medicaments, and external Applications. As for Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy it is here fruitleſs, becauſe the Humor is cold, unleſs the Veins be very full, the Blood black, and Age and Strength conſpire: for then it is expedient, becauſe ſo the Humors in the Maſs of Blood will be more fluxible; and the quantity being diminiſhed, the Natural Heat will the more eaſily rule the reſidue. If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be cauſed in a man by reaſon of the Hemorrhoides ſtopped, then Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are to be applied; if in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by reaſon of the Menſtrues ſuppreſt, then the <hi>Saphaena</hi> is to be opened.</p>
                     <p>As for the Dyet then, the Meat muſt be of eaſie digeſtion, moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and affording a thin Juyce: ſuch are Chickens, young Pigeons and Mountain Fowl, Lamb, Veal, young Pullets and Cockrels, fed Rabbets, Poched Eggs, <hi>Aſparagus</hi> Sallet, Spinage, Burrage, Purſelain: Bread of good Wheat not too much leavened is convenient. Let the Drink be ſmall White Wine, or reaſonable ſtrong Beer well boiled, clear, and neither too old, nor too new; good Cyder alſo with Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Burrage, Bugloſs burned, and Sugar is good. Meats which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a groſs Juyce are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as old Beef, all Meats dried in the Smoak, Veniſon, Fiſh living in muddy Waters, all Salt Meats, courſe Bread, the immoderate uſe of Vinegar is hurtful: Apple-tarts, and Warden and Pear-pyes baked with Fenil-ſeeds and Anniſeeds will ſerve inſtead of other Sweat-meats. Let the Habitation of the diſeaſed party be in a pure, hot and moiſt Air: too much Sleep, Idleneſs; Grief and Penſiveneſs are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. As for internal Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ought to purge Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and thick and glutinous Phlegm; but both of theſe are to be prepared before they are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. Thoſe Medicaments which prepare Melancholy, ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate or make thin, and moiſten, ſuch are the Syrups of the Juyce of Burrage, Bugloſs, the Syrups of Fumitery, Hops and Apples, with the decoction of Balm, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, <hi>Scolopendria,</hi> Tamarisk, and ſuch like. Thoſe Medicaments which prepare Phlegm, ought to be of an attenuating, and mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying quality, as the Syrup of Hyſope, of Betony, of <hi>Staechas, Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> and <hi>Mel roſatum</hi> in a decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Calamint, Hore-hound Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal, and ſuch like. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors being prepared, they are to be purged: Melancholy is to be purged with <hi>Confectio Hamech, Electuarium Indum,</hi> Pills <hi>De La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide lazuli,</hi> the extract of black Ellebor, <hi>Electuarium Lenitivum,</hi> and the like, which may be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the infuſion of Sena-leaves and Polypodie. Phlegm is to be purged with <hi>Diaphoenicum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carthamum,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52816:41"/>Hiera Pachii, Pilulae de agarico &amp; Hermodactylis, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbith,</hi> and the like. Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are to be miniſtred in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of thoſe Simples which prepare Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that nothing is more effectual in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing theſe Scirrhoſities, than the continual taking of the Decoction of <hi>Sarſa Parilla,</hi> and <hi>Guajacum</hi> inſtead of other Drink, uſing a convenient Dyet, and procuring every other Morning ſweating: for <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>gnum Vitae</hi> warmeth, and <hi>Sarſa</hi> diſſolveth the hardneſs: if it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this in Nodes, which are far harder than any <hi>Scirrhus</hi> poſſibly can be; why ſhould it not perform this office in a <hi>Scirrhus?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here it is no wonder if few be cured: for ſundry are impatient if their expectation be not ſpeedily anſwered; and beſides this, they are unwilling to gain their health, by foregoing their ſenſuality and pleaſure, being <hi>Ventris Mancipia,</hi> more careful of their Palate than health.</p>
                     <p>In external Applications, which are fit to be uſed in the Cure of <hi>a Scirrhus,</hi> you are to conſider three things; their Faculties, their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and the right uſe of them. As for the Faculties then of the local Medicaments, they ought to be diſcuſſing and ſoftning, <hi>emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lientia,</hi> and <hi>diſcutientia.</hi> Repelling Medicaments are not to be uſed, becauſe the Humor is thick, and hard, and ſo unapt to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Of emollient Medicaments there are four degrees: in the firſt are thoſe which are gentleſt; ſuch are Mans-greaſe, Capons-greaſe, the Marrow of Harts, and Calves-bones, Ducks-greaſe, Swines-greaſe, ſweet Butter. <hi>Galen</hi> adviſes to apply to gentle Scirrhoſities, a Medicament made of ſweet Butter, black Roſin; and new Wax. <hi>Dialthaea Simplex</hi> is of this Degree. In the ſecond Degree are theſe, Gooſe-greaſe, Badgers-greaſe, Dogs-greaſe, old rank Oyl, Oyl of Linſeed. In the third Degree, are, the Fat of Lions, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, Libards, and the Marrow of Horſes, and Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. In the fourth Degree, are <hi>Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Bdellium, Caranna, Tacamahaca, Opopanax,</hi> of theſe Simples you may frame unto your ſelves ſuch Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the quality of the <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> which you are to take in hand, ſhall require. <hi>Raſes</hi> in all Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoſities commends a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm, and it is excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>The Deſcription may thus be framed, take of <hi>Bdellium, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum,</hi> and <hi>Galbanum,</hi> of each 1 ℥. diſſolve theſe in a hot Mortar with Oyl of Lilies, add of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage or Pulp of roſted Figs ij ℥. of the Mucilage of Linſeed and Fenugreek, vj ℥. make up a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm, dreſs the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> with this Cataplaſm once a day. <hi>Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon cum gummi,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum de Macilaginibus</hi> are convenient. <hi>Riolan</hi> the Father commends this Medicament; Take of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Althaea,</hi> of <hi>Diachylon cum gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi &amp; Emplaſtrum de Mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus</hi> of each 1 ℥. of the Oyl of Lilies vj. drams: mingle theſe well together, you may add to theſe Medicaments ſome Vinegar to help penetration. If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be above a Nerve or a Tendon,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52816:41"/>inſtead of Vinegar you may uſe the Spirit of Wine.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be obſerved, that before you apply any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament, the part affected is to be fomented with the decoction of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Melilot, and Cowſlip-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Vinegar, unto which after it is boiled, ſome Spirit of Wine is to be added.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the right uſe of local means, theſe Obſervations following are worth the noting; The Firſt is: If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the melancholick Humor, which is cold, thick, and dry, you are to apply a Medicament which warms, attenuates, and moiſtens. II. If the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be engendred of cold, thick, and tough Phlegm, then the Medicament ought to be warming, attenuating, cutting, and mundifying. III. Tender Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Parts require milder; but Parts and Perſons harder and ſtronger require more forcible means. IV. If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> has been procured, becauſe an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon has applied Medicaments too much repelling or diſcuſſing to an Inflammation; then apply this mollifying Liniment; Take of Yellow Wax, and Ducks Greaſe tryed, of each j <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. of Oil of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ij ℥. of the Marrow of Ox Bones ij ℥. mingle them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. V. If immoderate uſe of drying Topicks hath procured hardneſs, then Medicaments moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are to be uſed: ſuch is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm made of Mallows boiled, and Capons Greaſe, or Swines Greaſe. <hi>Hildanus Obſ. Chirurg.</hi> 79. <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. relates how a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of <hi>Berne</hi> had grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed her Right Hand, which put her to much pain in her Wriſt, and cauſed her Hand to ſwell. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers remedies were uſed; but it ended in a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> She went to him, and he found a very hard <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> on the inſide of her Right Wriſt, as big as a Hens Egg; ſhe could not bend her Fingers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> ſtuck faſt to the Muſcle, which bends the Fingers, and to that part of it where it is diſtributed into four fleſhy parts. After uſing Univerſals, ſuch as were requiſite, he applied a potential Cautery; after the Eſchar was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, a thin Matter ouzed out for ſeveral days: Afterwards, when the Fleſh was eroded deeper with Eſcharoticks, a thick, viſcous, and yellowiſh Matter ſhewed it ſelf, which he was forced to ſqueeze out with ſome violence, having firſt dilated the Ulcer with Sponges. This Matter, after it had been for ſome hours expoſed to the Air, turned as hard as a ſtone. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a great deal of ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at ſeveral times. For a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was found from the Ulcer, which reached from the upper part of the Wriſt towards the Elbow, to the Palm of the Hand under the tranſverſe Ligament, and entring the Palm, between the extuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Fifth and Eighth Bone of the Wriſt. When the Ulcer was Mundified, he ſucceſsfully cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it.</p>
                     <p>Unto a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> theſe Tumors may be referred, <hi>Strumae,</hi> Warts, Corns, Leproſie. As for <hi>Strumae</hi> and the Leproſie, they will require ſeveral Tracts.</p>
                     <p>Warts, if the root be ſmall and the top broad, may be taken away
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52816:42"/>by Ligature; if the root be broad, they muſt be extirpate with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. There I commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you ſtrong <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis infernalis</hi> relented; theſe muſt be applyed to the Warts with a Ruſh or a Straw.

                     <p>Corns muſt firſt be artificially cut, and then only theſe Medicaments which I ſhall name, muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: <hi>Ammoniacum</hi> diſſolved in Vinegar, and brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of <hi>Cerot, emplaſtorum de mucilaginibus,</hi> and <hi>Diachylon cum gummi.</hi>

                     <p>Nevertheleſs, ſeeing aqueous or watry and flatuous Tumors are often preſented to Chirurgeons to be cured, I think it expedient to diſcourſe of theſe, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tumors may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then I will diſcourſe of the aqueous, and then of the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Tumor. The material cauſe of the aqueous Tumor by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians is called <hi>Serum,</hi> or <hi>Seroſus humor.</hi> Of this Humor there is but a ſmall quantity in a healthful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; no more than is fit to make the Blood thin, that it may be the more readily carried unto all the parts of the Body to afford them nouriſhment. This being done, it is diſcharged through the Pores of the Skin, either by Sweat, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Perſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> not without reaſon affirms all Seroſity to be an Excrement.</p>
                     <p>This Seroſity is not only of a moiſt and wateriſh ſubſtance; but of a ſalt quality in like manner; yea, this Seroſity, Urine, and Sweat have the ſame Matter: yet they differ; for <hi>Serum</hi> is that aqueous Humidity which is contained in the Blood: and although Blood be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52816:42"/>drawn, yet it cannot be diſcerned unleſs the Blood grow cold and congeal, and this thin part by the concretion of the Blood be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the thicker. But Urine is nothing elſe but the ſuperfluity of this Seroſity of the Blood ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the wateriſh Humidity of Meat and Drink, and ſeparated from the maſs of Blood, and drawn by the attractive faculty of the emulgent Veins and Ridneys, and by the Ureters ſent to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there to be detained until the convenient time of excretion. So that this kind of excretion pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Blood from wateriſh Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, whereby it is made more firm, and ſo more fit to nouriſh the parts. As for Sweat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Perſpiration, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the excrements of the ſolid parts. Nevertheleſs, they carry with them ſome obſcure ſigns of the conſtitution and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Body. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Cauſes will increaſe the ſeroſity of Blood; as Meats afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plenty of wateriſh Humidity, as moſt Fruits, cold Herbs, and immoderate uſe of Water, and other Drinks: for although ſome Drinks be hotter than others, yet all of them have more wateriſh Humidity than Spirit, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſtemperature and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the parts appointed for Sanguification, oftentimes this Seroſity is not ſeparated from the alimentary Humors; but is detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and increaſed, and not expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Urine and Sweat: from whence the Dropſie, Fevers, and Puſtules of the Skin do proceed.</p>
                     <p>An aqueous or wateriſh Tumor then is cauſed of the ſuperfluity of this Seroſity detained in the Body, after that it has performed its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is, when it has carried the nouriſhment through the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages: ſuch are the meſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raical Veins. If too much of this wateriſh Humidity be ſent to the habit of the Body, and move the expelling faculty, then part of it is ſent to the Skin, which cauſes wateriſh Tumors. Thoſe which heave up the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> are called <hi>Sudamina.</hi> Thoſe which ariſe in the night time are called <hi>Epinycti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although neither <hi>Fallopius</hi> nor <hi>Tagaultius</hi> have made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wateriſh Tumors, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to pituitous Tumors, yet theſe Tumors wherein nothing elſe but wateriſh Humidity is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do plainly evince, that an aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tumor is one diſtinct from all others. Superfluity of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is ſent to the habit of the Body: partly becauſe the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kidneys, doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſufficiently to draw it: partly becauſe the Liver is too cold, and Laſtly, by reaſon of ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror committed in the uſe of the things not natural, as immoderate taking of Water, and other drink, as Wine, Ale, Beer, Cider. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a wateriſh Tumor are theſe, Firſt, It is ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs ſwollen, yet it yieldeth when it is preſſed hard, whereby it is diſcerned from a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi> It is diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are painful, but it not.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52816:43"/>It is diſcerned from an <hi>Oedema</hi> by this, That it being preſſed, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no pit, as an <hi>Oedema</hi> doth. It being beaten it yieldeth no noiſe, as a flatuous Tumor doth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a Tympany. Laſt of all, when it breeds, there is always an itching in the part, by reaſon of the Saltneſs, which is in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Humidity; Theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors appear in the Navel, Cods, and the habit or compaſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: yet moſt frequently in the joynts of the Arms and Legs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe parts being weak, cold, thick, are apteſt to admit ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Tumors. As for the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks, that wateriſh Tumor which happens by reaſon of any imperfection of the Sanguification, is dangerous; not ſo much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Tumor it ſelf, as of the infirmity of Sanguificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Other wateriſh Tumors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not ſo dangerous, yet by reaſon of the weakneſs, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and thickneſs of the Skin, are not ſo eaſily cured. As for thoſe Tumors which riſe in the compaſs of the Body, like to Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or ſmall Bladders, and are called <hi>Sudamina,</hi> as they are no ways dangerous, ſo they are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured. As for the Cure of this Grief, Reaſon and Experience have found out four means to meet with it, to wit, a convenient Diet, internal Medicaments, external Applications, and manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If then an univerſal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity poſſeſs the whole Body, the Diet muſt be drying, wherefore roaſted Meat is better than boiled. Immoderation in Drink is by all means to be ſhunned: For

                     <p>And as Temperance and Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety have a promiſe of prolonging our temporal Lives, ſo are they powerful helps in curing Diſeaſes; but chiefly thoſe which are cauſed by the ſuperfluity of moiſt and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh Humors. Fleſh then is better than Fiſh, and of Fleſh Meats thoſe are beſt which are dryeſt: Kid then is better than Lamb, Veal than Muton, Rabbets and Conies are good, Land-Fowl are better than Water-Fowl. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf commendeth Pork above Pigs-fleſh: but neither of both is good; for Pigs-fleſh is exceeding moiſt, and in Pork the Fat is moiſt, and diſſolves the Stomach, but the lean is hard, and not eaſily concocted. All ſupping Meats are to be ſhunned, for they multiply moiſture. <hi>Ludovicus Cornarus</hi> his Diet recorded by <hi>Leſſius</hi> in his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaſtieon,</hi> or Treatiſe concerning preſervation of Health, is fit for ſuch perſons. For above the ſpace of Forty years, he reſted content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day with xij ℥. of Bread and Meat, and xiiij ℥. of Drink: when he was 80 years of age, ſo able he was by the obſervation of this moderate Diet, that without any advantage of ground, he uſually backt the faireſt <hi>Italian</hi> Horſes. One thing is to be noted, that ſeeing ſuperfluous Humidity ſeldom poſſeſſes the Body, unleſs there be ſome fault in the Sanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Kidneys, you muſt by all means labour to reduce them to their natural temperature. The means to compaſs this are ſet down
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52816:43"/>by every one who hath penned the practice of Phyſick, unto whom I remit you.</p>
                     <p>The internal Medicaments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the expugnation of this Grief, are of three ſorts: for either they purge by Stool, or by Urine, or by Sweat, and inſenſible Perſpiration. To touch the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick Medicaments, ſuch are one grain of <hi>Elaterium</hi> with a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pilulae Cochiae,</hi> or <hi>de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbio,</hi> or <hi>Aloephanginae:</hi> Two Drams of the Seed of Dwarf-Elder, or <hi>Ebulus</hi> beaten to Powder and miniſtred in White Wine, and a ſpoonful of the juyce of <hi>Ebulus,</hi> the Flour-de-luce, or <hi>ſoldanella</hi> mingled with ij ℥. of the Syrup of Damask Roſes, diſſolved in ij oun. of White Wine. The purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diet is excellent, if you add to the ordinary Purgatives in it, the roots of <hi>Eſula major,</hi> the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Buckthorn, and <hi>Carthamus</hi> Seeds. Amongſt all the Simples Mechoacan and Jalap are moſt commended, both for their effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in working, and ſafety in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring. As for Diuretical means, I commend unto you this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament: Take of the Aſhes of Broom, and Bean-ſtraw burned, of each a good handful; ſtrain through thoſe Aſhes, iiij. pints of Rheniſh-wine three times: then infuſe in this Wine of the root of Saſſafras ſliced ij ℥. of Nutmegs and Cinnamon, of each two drams; of Bay-berries, and Juniper-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of each ſix in number, of Cummin-ſeeds ij<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. of Fennel-ſeeds, and Anniſeeds, of each one dram and an half, of Sugar four Ounces, of the Spirit of Salt one dram. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter every Morning four Ounces of this Wine ſtrained, and ſo much about four of the clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: the Decoction alſo of Penniroyal, Time, Calamint, with Seeds of the Melon, Pompion, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber and Purſlain, made plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the Syrup of <hi>Althea, de quinque radicibus,</hi> and of Hyſop miniſtred as the former, is good.</p>
                     <p>As for Diaphoretick Medicines, the Decoction of <hi>Guajacum Sarſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parilla, Saſſafras,</hi> and <hi>China</hi>-root, with Agrimony, Betony and Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander; ſweet Fennel-ſeeds, and Anniſeeds carry away the Bell. How effectual theſe Medicaments are, being judiciouſly uſed, not in this Grief only, but in moiſt Ulcers alſo, and other Diſeaſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, I need not to labour to perſwade. When theſe Decoctions are miniſtred, a ſtrict Diet muſt be enjoyned, and plentiful Sweat procured, according to the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the diſeaſed Party.</p>
                     <p>The topical Remedies ought not to be repercuſſives, although the Humor be thin, becauſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature can make no uſe of it, it is to be evacuated: wherefore the Remedies ought to diſcuſs and rarefie the Skin, that vent may be given to the Humor. <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius ab aqua pendente</hi> commends this Medicament; Take of Mallow Leaves an handful and a half, of the Meal of Lupines, j℥. of the Oil of Dill and Chamomil of each ij ℥. with f. q. of White Wine, make up a Cataplaſm. The Lie of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlacked Lime, and branches of the Vine are good. <hi>Avicen</hi> out of <hi>Galen,</hi> againſt wateriſh Tumors deſcribes thus the emplaſter of Muſtard, and affirms, that if this Medicament prevail not, there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52816:44"/>is but ſmall hope that any other will. Take of Muſtard-ſeed, Nettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Brimſtone, <hi>Ariſtolochia ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunda,</hi> of the Foam of the Sea, or Brine and Bdellium, of each j ℥. of <hi>Ammoniacum,</hi> old Oyl, and Wax, of each j <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. make a Cerot accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art. Let me advertiſe you of one thing, that the part is to be fomented before either Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm or Emplaſter be applyed. The Fomentation is to be made of a Lie made of Bean-ſtraw, Broom, and twigs of the Vine burned with ſome ordinary Aſhes, wherein you are to boil common Wormwood, Sea-Wormwood, the leſſer Centory, Calamint, Cummin-ſeeds, Bay-berries, Juniper-berries, <hi>Scordium,</hi> Chamomil-flowers, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot-flowers, and tops of Dill; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Decoction ſtrained add the ſixth part of Sherry Sack. Now to come to the laſt Remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for rebellious wateriſh Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, to wit, manual operation. If they cannot be diſcuſſed, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <hi>Hydrocephalos</hi> and <hi>Hernia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aquoſa</hi> cannot; then the Humor is to be let out ſometimes by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſometimes by a cauſtick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament: then the part is to be mundified: Thirdly, It is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate; and Laſt of all cicatrized. But ſeeing I have handled theſe points when I diſcourſed of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtem, and that I am to ſet down what is ſingular in every Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Operation, whereby ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities are taken from the Body, in that part of Chirurgery which is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>HAving ſet down the Doctrine of a wateriſh Tumor, I ſhall ſpeak of a Flatulent Tumor; in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> it is called <hi>Tumor flatulentus,</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi>

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>The perſon in whoſe Body Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſities are multiplied, is often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with gudlings in his ſides, he belches often, he is troubled with ſinging of the Ears, his Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come forth with Flatuoſity, his Urine is frothy, he finds a ſtretching of his Belly, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heavineſs.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of Flatuoſity are Crudity and weak Heat. The Heat may be accounted weak two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways. 1. Of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo it has ſome Power and Dominion over the Humor, and doth in ſome ſort diſſolve it, but imperfectly; and ſo it produces ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lituous Vapours, which are called Flatuoſities, but is not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs them; and ſo they remain in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52816:44"/>part, and diſtend it, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Flatuoſities are groſs, and the part thick: this appears often in the Knees, and troubles Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Phyſicians much. 2. Heat may be accounted weak, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Matter it ſelf; when as the Matter is ſo plentiful, that the Heat cannot wholly overcome it, but leaves ſome Vapours undiſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of Crudity are Ebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Gluttony, a ſedentary Life, and flatuous Meats and Drinks; ſuch are Beer and Ale not well boiled, Peaſe, Beans, Cheſnuts, Turnips, Radiſhes, green Fruit, Swines Fleſh, water-Fowl, ſalt Fiſh, and ſuch like. It is diſcerned from a wateriſh Tumor, whereof we have ſpoken by the lightneſs of it; for an Aqueous Tumor is heavy, but this not. Secondly, By diſtending the Membranes, and ſtretching of them, it cauſeth often intolerable pain, whereas in wateriſh no pain is felt. It is diſcerned from an <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema</hi> by this, that it admits no pitting, although it be preſſed: it is diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> becauſe this is hard, but it not: it is diſcerned from a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> and <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> for in it the Skin is not diſcoloured, neither is there any extraordinary Heat felt; but in thoſe both appear.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks, receive theſe; If theſe Flatuoſities poſſeſs parts very ſenſible, as great Joynts, ſuch are the Elbows, or Knees, which are compaſſed with thick Membranes, they are hardly cured, and will buſie the moſt skilful.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe which invade other parts, they are not very eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Firſt, becauſe theſe halituous Spirits are groſs. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the parts thorow which they are to be diſcuſſed are thick. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe the natural Heat is weak. Whoſoever goes about to cure theſe flatuous Tumors; Firſt, he muſt preſcribe a ſtrict Diet to the Patient, ſuch as I have ſet down in the cure of a wateriſh Tumor. Secondly, he muſt bar him of the uſe of all flatuous Aliments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have made mention, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto him Meats of eaſie concoction, and which afford a laudable Juyce. After Meals let him eat a ſlice of Marmalad of Quinces, with ſome Coriander, and Anniſeed-Comſits, having but one covering of Sugar. The Stomach a little before Bed-time is to be embrocated with the Oil of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Wormwood and Rue.</p>
                     <p>As for the Topical Remedies, the part firſt is to be fomented with <hi>Sheres</hi> Sack, wherein Dill, Rue, Bay-leaves, Chamomil, and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot-flowers, Cummin-ſeeds, Anniſe-ſeeds, Fennil-ſeeds, and Bay-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been infuſed. Then the part is to be embrocated with the Oyl of Chamomil, Lilies, Dill, Rue and Bayes mingled with <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae.</hi> Thirdly, apply to the part the Cummin emplaſter, or that of Bay-berries: if the Patient do feel inflation in his Stomach, or in the region of the Spleen, miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of the Confection of Bay-berries ij, ℥. in three Ounces ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of good Hippocras, or Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wine, wherein Cinnamon hath been infuſed two hours before Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ii j. or iii j. drops of the Oyl of Pepper, or vj. of Fennel-ſeed Oyl in the Sack-poſſet drink, are good. Digeſtion is furthered in ſuch
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52816:45"/>perſons, if they take a cup of Sack having a Toaſt in it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eat the Toaſt, being firſt beſprinkled with Sugar. To ſuch a remedy the meaneſt may attain, and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Take it two bours before Supper.</p>

Now the Glands are of two ſorts. One ſort is connate with our Body and the parts of it: Another is adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious and preternatural. The firſt have ſome uſe; the latter none. They either ſerve for the diviſions of the Veſſels, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe ſuperfluous Humors, or to irrigate the Parts. Beſides, there are Glandulous Bodies, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be called Glands; ſo the Teſticles, Breaſts and other Parts are Glandulous Bodies, <hi>i. e</hi> like Glands. The adventitious and preternatural Glands are bred in almoſt all the Parts of the Body, moſt frequently in the Fat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fleſh and vacuities of the Muſcles; ſometimes in Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and Exanguous Parts, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the extremities of the Veſſels, from Blood, Phlegm, <hi>Mucus,</hi> and other redounding Humors. And all theſe Glands are ſubject to Scrophulous Tumors, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the whole Body may be troubled with the King's Evil. The Matter of theſe Tumors is reckoned Phlegm or <hi>Serum</hi> (this being a new word Homonymous to the Ancients Phlegm.)</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is either primigeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of it ſelf, not following an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Diſeaſe: Or Secondary, which follows ſome other Diſeaſe, as an Inflammation. It either proceeds from Fluxion of an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor from ſome where elſe, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the Head by the Veſſels: Or by Collection or Congeſtion, which is bred of the Reliques of the proper Aliment, which the Glands through weakneſs of heat and laxity of ſubſtance could not expel. The diverſity of Matter whereof the King's Evil is bred, which is various Humors, makes ſeveral differences of it. There is a difference in quantity; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52816:45"/>there are many Knots, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times few, ſometimes large, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmall; Sometimes it is mild, ſometimes malignant. One is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, another internal. One is moveable, another fixt. One has Veins, Arteries and Nerves impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, another has none.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes external are a thick, ſoggy, moiſt Air, bad Water, ſuch as comes from the <hi>Alps</hi> when the Snow melts, and intemperance in Meat and Drink. The internal Efficient Cauſes are Intemperature of the inner Parts, Cacochymy, a bad Liver, a weak Stomach or Brain, an ill made Head. The material Cauſe is Phlegm or <hi>Serum,</hi> with a medley of the other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>The King's Evil is very like to a Gland, a Node, and to all thoſe Abſceſſes which Practitioners call Phlegmatick. But the Evil is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from a Gland, becauſe a Gland is ſoft and without pain; the Evil, if it be touched feels hard and is painful. A Gland is ſingle and only one; the Evil conſiſts of many Knots. A Gland ſlips, when preſſed, and returns again; the Evil gives not way to the touch. A Gland is uſually Cutaneous, the Evil lies deep. As for a <hi>Ganglium</hi> it is indeed a round Body; but it differs from the Evil, becauſe it is only in a Nervous Part. Nodes according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Latins, are pituitous Tumors, encloſed in Membranes, which gradually increaſe, as the Evil does; but they are ſeparable from the ſubject parts, and the Evil ſticks faſt to the Fleſh. A Node breeds in any; the Evil only in a glandulous part. As for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing of one King's Evil from another, the effloreſcence of the Humor in the Skin, which colours it, ſhews what Humor cauſes the Evil.</p>
                     <p>The Prognoſticks are theſe, I. Every King's Evil is difficult to cure, becauſe it comes from a groſs Humor, becauſe it is contained in a Coat of its own, and becauſe it is hard and ſcirrhous. II. Many Knots are more difficult to cure than one, the painful, than one without pain; the Melancholick than the Phlegmatick; the fixt than the moveable; in the fore part of the Neck, than in any other part. III. <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, the King's Evil tires Phyſicians, becauſe it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Fevers, nor ever comes to Maturation, whether it be treated with Inſtrument or Medicine; and therefore it often riſes again in the very Scar it leſt. IV. The Evil often ulcerates, when the Humor is putrid, when it is hot, or irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Applications; ſometimes it turns Scirrhous, ſometimes <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous.</hi> V. This Diſeaſe, according to <hi>Aph.</hi> 26. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. is familiar to Children. VI. And in <hi>Coac. Praene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hippocrates</hi> ſays, the Evil ſeldom comes after forty years of Age. VII. Such as have a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now Forehead, flat Temples, broad and prominent Cheek-bones, and a narrow Neck, theſe are very liable to the Evil. VIII. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> l. 2. <hi>Prorrhetic.</hi> ſays, that as to theſe, Biles turn to <hi>Pus;</hi> and indeed Strumous ones ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children, and they go away again eaſily; but as they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom grow in elder Boys and Youths, ſo they go away with the more difficulty. But in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52816:46"/>grown men ſuch Swellings ſeldom ariſe.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Supernatural and Miraculous; or Natural. The Supernatural and Miraculous Cure of the King's Evil (waving all Metaphyſical Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and Theogical Concerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it) I dare affirm to be one of the <hi>Regalia</hi> annext to the Crown of Great Britain, the gift being no way obliged to any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Form of Religion; ſince our own Experience as well as Hiſtory informs us, that Princes of different Perſwaſions in Religion have equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their Sacred Touch in the Name of the Moſt High, cured mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Evil, called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King cures it, <hi>the King's Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſince all People aſſlicted with this Diſeaſe have not the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to approach the Royal Preſence, and receive the Bleſſings of his Hand, it is a Work becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a skilful Chirurgion to ſupply a Miracle by his skill in Nature, and to ſave a Subject, where his Majeſty is not preſent by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand to do it. That it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done (tho difficult) there want not Inſtances of ſeveral in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> cured of the King's Evil by a Method of Phyſick. For beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Doctor <hi>Willoughby</hi> at this preſent in <hi>London</hi> cures ſeveral of this pertinacious Diſeaſe, he having been very induſtrious to conquer it, and having ſpent much of his Medical Studies upon Enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this very particular Malady. He has likewiſe ſome <hi>Arcana,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he effects ſtrange Cures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſons diſaffected with the Evil; yet he frankly acknowledges that the ſame Method and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, in ſeveral Patients have quite different Effects, and that without proceeding Methodically nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to be done. Method therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of a True Phyſician, I ſhall endeavour Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically to lay down the Cure of the King's Evil.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diaetetick part, the Air muſt be thin, dry, ſerene, pure and open to the Eaſt. Avoid a thick, foggy, moiſt, rainy, fenny and a Weſtern Air. If it be not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, let it be rendred ſo by Art. Smell to a Pomamber. Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is good ſometimes, becauſe it dries. The Bread muſt be well baked and ſeaſoned with Aniſe or ſweet Fenilſeed. Avoid all Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats and Sweet-meats and Pulſe. The Meat muſt be of good Juyce; Avoid all young, mucilaginous and fat Fleſh, Pork and Feet of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes. Sup little Spoon-meat. Eat roaſt Meat rather than boiled. Fiſh and Fruit are bad. Avoid much drinking, and corrupt Waters. But Spaw-waters are good. A Dyet drink altered with Roſemary, Thyme and Sage is good. And ſo is a <hi>China</hi> Drink. Maſtich Wood ſtrengthens all the nutritious Parts, invigorates the Blood and Humors, is amicable to the Brain, and keeps the Belly looſe. Never ſleep on the day. Uſe Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Keep the Body looſe. Purge the Head, and apply Bags to it. Uſe Sneezing.</p>
                     <p>In the King's Evil there are two Indications of Cure. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves or diminiſhes the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe. The ſecond takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Conjunct Cauſe. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cauſe of the Evil is a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52816:46"/>Humor, either ſimple, or mixt with another Humor, which reſides ſometimes in the Veins, ſometimes in the Brain, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the ſent of Phlegm. Therefore the luxuriant and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humor muſt firſt be evacuated, and then the Temperament and Strength muſt be reſtored to the Parts. Evacuation is either Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Inſenſible. Senſible eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation is made by Vomit, Stool, Sweat and Bleeding. A Vomit is good, if there be much crudities in the Stomach. One may be given <hi>de decocto raphani, ſemine atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicis, floribus geniſtae, &amp; Oxyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> or <hi>Diaſarum Fernelii,</hi> or this; ℞ <hi>Oxymel. ſimpl.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocti ſem. atripl. hord. flor. geniſt.</hi> ℥ iiij. <hi>M. hauriat tepidè.</hi> It is good to vomit in the Morning faſting. Purging with <hi>Diaturbith</hi> and ſuch things is good. Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks of the Woods are good: Mineral Waters are proper, ſuch as the <hi>Spaw</hi> and <hi>Borbonne.</hi> Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks may be given, when the Body is well purged and clean. Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection in this caſe is ſeldom proper. When the whole Body is purged, the Head may be likewiſe purged by Apophlegmatiſms, Errhines, Sternutatories. Iſſues in the Neck and Arms, and Bliſters are proper. Thus the material Antecedent Cauſe of the Evil may be removed by ſenſible Evacuation. It may alſo be inſenſibly evacuated by ſuch things as by degrees ſoak up, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The Conjunct Cauſe of Tumors may be thus removed. Every Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor according to <hi>Galen</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſperſed, or ſuppurated, or it turns ſcirrhous, or it gangrenes. Hot Tumors are eaſily diſperſed and ſuppurated, becauſe the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them is thin and capable of coction: Cold ones with difficulty: and the Evil is well known to be of ſuch a Nature. Yet when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, it is capable of Reſolution and Suppuration. One confirmed, and turned to a ſcirrhous ſubſtance, is ſometimes cured by Emollients and Diſcutients. But one that will not give way to the foreſaid Medicines, can only be cured by the Knife, Fire and Corroſives. Begin always with the gentleſt means firſt. When therefore the <hi>Strumae</hi> are ſmall and beginning, and are but incloſed in a tender Membrane, they are eaſily cured. For ſqueeze, bruiſe and rub them with the hand till they grow hot, at firſt they grow

                        </gap>, which teaches to unite parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Solution of Unity I made twofold: either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, to be apprehended by Reaſon or Underſtanding; or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which may be perceived by the very Senſes. The intelligible I named a Tumor, in which very often no Solution of Unity offers it ſelf either to the ſight or touch, as in many cholerick Tumors, and others in their beginning. Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Solution of Unity, I affirmed either to be in the ſoft parts or in hard. As for the Solution of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the ſoft Parts, I appointed two Differences of it; to wit, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Vulnus,</hi> an Ulcer and a Wound.</p>
                     <p>In my proceeding, I will handle theſe ten Points: I. I will point out the Authors who have written laudably of this Subject. II. I will ſet down the Definition of an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. III. The Cauſes of an Ulcer.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52816:48"/>IV. The Differences of Ulcers. V. The general Signs of Ulcers. VI. The general Prognoſticks of Ulcers. VII.

IX. Of their times. X. I will diſcourſe of every particular ſort of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, to come to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I mean not to name all who are come to our hands, and have written of this Subjects but ſuch as are famous for their Skill and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> though they have not left to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity particular large Monuments of this Matter, yet when occaſion is offered, they omit not to ſet down both the Indications of Cure, and Medicaments effectual to cure. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 6.

Galen</hi> in thoſe excellent Books of his, which he penned, <hi>De method. medendi, lib.</hi> 3. of a Simple Ulcer, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. or an Ulceer with Accidents, of the orderly way to cure Diſeaſes, for the moſt part doth illuſtrate his Precepts by Examples borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Practice of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery.</p>
                     <p>If you demand why he did ſo?</p>
                     <p>I will tell you the Cauſe in <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> his words, in his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ulcers, <hi>Quoniamut ait Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Quum cadem eſt,</hi> Seeing according to <hi>Celſus,</hi> the means which Phyſicians uſe in curing, ſometimes take effect, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times avail not, it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether Health may be aſcribed to the good conſtitution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or to the means applied; but the effect of Chirurgery is moſt evident. O pregnant teſtimony to evince the certainty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chirurgery! Let thoſe Phyſicians who ſlight the Practice of Chirurgery, thinking themſelves to be Chicks of the white Hen only, conſider and weigh the weight of this Teſtimony of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Fallopius</hi> in the impartial ballance of Reaſon. <hi>Avicen,</hi> the chief of the Arabian Phyſicians, handles this Matter in the fourth Book of his Canon, and the third Treatiſe: although he writes confuſedly; yet the reading of him will profit ſuch as underſtand him, and will not be fruitleſs. <hi>Albucaſis</hi> has ſome good things, but the number of the trifles are many more. <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixth Book, <hi>Of the Art of Curing,</hi> only touches ſome Points of this Matter, as a Dog doth <hi>Nilus</hi> when he drinks. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Fallopius</hi> follows, who has written an excellent Treatiſe of this Matter; but whoſoever ſhall peruſe him, ſhall find him in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things intricate enough: I will bring him a new Companion, but far ſurpaſſing all other Modern Writers, <hi>Minadous,</hi> one of the Famous Profeſſors of that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Univerſity of <hi>Padua,</hi> in his three Books which he penned of the curing of the Deformities of the Body of Man: Whoſoever he be who ſhall go about to make a parity between theſe two and others of the late Writers, I ſhall judge him worthy of <hi>Midas</hi> his Ears, and after that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and been promoted in <hi>Germany,</hi> to be ſaluted a Doctor with four Feet.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52816:48"/>Haffenreferus,</hi> in his Four Books of the Affections of the Skin, in whom there are many varieties, if one with judgment diſcern them. The reſt that can be named are of the lower Bench, as <hi>Guido de Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaco,</hi> and he who hath only taught him to ſpeak a little more clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Joannes Tagaultius,</hi> in the Third Book of his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chirurgery. <hi>Joannes de Vigo</hi> accounted the Father of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. <hi>Marianus Sanctus</hi> in the Third Treatiſe of his <hi>Compendium</hi> of Chirurgery, and <hi>Angelus Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logninus</hi> in his two Books of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhall bear him company. I muſt not omit that painful and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Chirurgeon <hi>Ambroſe Parrey,</hi> unto whom Chirurgery is much beholding. <hi>Veſalius</hi> alſo deſerves praiſe. The two lateſt who have written are the two <hi>Fabricii, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <hi>William: Hieronymus Fabricius</hi> in the Third Book of the Second Part of his Chirurgical Works: <hi>Gulielmus Fabricius</hi> in his Learned Chirurgical Obſervations, who in this courſe out-ſtrip all their fellows. Theſe Authors of all other are moſt to be peruſed; for in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, one ſhall become both more underſtanding, and more able to perform the Cures which ſhall be committed to his care and skill. As for the reſt, I leave them unto thoſe who rather chuſe to feed upon Acorns, than pure Mancliet. <hi>Riolan</hi> the Father, <hi>Jaques Guilmeau, Peccetius</hi> and <hi>Pigraeus,</hi> although they deſerve their own praiſe, yet in my opinion they are to give place to thoſe whom I have named. If any one would miſpend good hours, let him read <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his great and little Chirurgery, which are like Clouds without Rain. If you would be furniſhed with Foreſts of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical Medicaments, peruſe the Treatiſe of the Learned <hi>Hollerius de materia Chirurgica,</hi> of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical means, and <hi>Jacobus Dondus</hi> in his enumeration of Chirurgical Remedies, both ſimple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Medicaments which in my proceedings I ſhall from time to time ſet down, they ſhall not be a confuſed heap, but a choice of the beſt approved, to eaſe you of the labour of Election.</p>
                     <p>Now are we to deſcend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinition of an Ulcer, which was the Second point: I will not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſetting down of ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of ſundry Authors, and the examination of them, becauſe this labour would take up too much time, and little edifie. An Ulcer in Engliſh is derived from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcus,</hi> and this from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, becauſe it disjoyneth the part which it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth; and ſo this term, in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſignification, comprehends every ſolution of unity: and ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning wounds of the Head, doth entitle it.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing ſolution of Unity may proceed from two Cauſes, to wit, an external inſtrument dividing, and a ſharp Humor eroding, according to <hi>Galen:</hi> there muſt be two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of ſolution of Unity like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe according to the ſame Author, <hi>de conſtit. art. c.</hi> 6. <hi>Vulnas,</hi> a wound, procured by an external inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>

                        </gap>, which properly ſignifies the little Worm which pierces Wood, and conſumes it. I ſee no reaſon why the name of an Ulcer may not be aſcribed to the ſolution of Unity in a Bone, if it proceed from an inward cauſe eroding, as the term of a wound is, if it be divided by an external inſtrument, as a Sword or Hatchet. An Ulcer then is a compound Diſeaſe; for in it there is both ſolution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, and loſs of ſubſtance.</p>

                        <p>Of the Cauſes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the third general concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ulcers, is ſet down by me the cauſes of Ulcers. Theſe are either antecedent or conjunct: The antecedent cauſes may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three; to wit, <hi>Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> or the evil habit of the Body; <hi>Contagium,</hi> or the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or imparting of an infecting quality, Vapour or Humor, by the which an Ulcer is cauſed in any part; a venemous moiſture, as in biting and ſtinging of Serpents; or laſtly, the diſtemperature of the part it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it belongs to the practice of Phyſick! yet in my Diſcourſes of Tuniors I ſet down the ſigns of every Humor redounding as much as was requiſite for any to know, who only meddles with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chirurgery. While any of the three Humors (Blood being excepted) in the maſſe of Blood contained in the Veins is faulty, and peccant in quality, it is accounted the cauſe antecedent of an Ulcer. Sometimes theſe Humors are ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, ſometimes they are aſſociate together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Contagium,</hi> or Infection, it is communicated ſometimes by a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and corroding Vapour; and ſo very often, if one viſit often one having a <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> ſuch Vapours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled with the Air, infect the party who viſits, eſpecially if he draw too near to the diſeaſed Party. So Ulcers of the Yard come from dealing with Women, whoſe Secret parts are touched with Venereal Ulcers: yea, the Itch it ſelf, and ſcabbedneſs, is gotten by either lying with one troubled with it, or by ſleeping in a Bed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52816:49"/>where a ſcabbed perſon hath reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>As for the diſtemperature of the Part, it may be procured either by Cold, as appears in Kibes; or by Heat, as we may ſee in a Gangrene, becauſe the Blood flowing copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the part pained, and not being concocted, it putrefies and erodes the part. Laſt of all, by biting or ſtinging, as of a mad Dog, or a venemous Serpent, a corruption of the Humors may be cauſed, the conjunct cauſe of an Ulcer: ſo that every Humor that is changed from its own natural temperature, whether it be by putrefaction, adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or commixtion of any thing unnatural, may procure an Ulcer, in whatſoever part it ſeats it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But the followers of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> ſpeak otherwiſe of theſe Humors than the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> do. The <hi>Galeniſis</hi> make the three Humors of the maſſe of Blood; to wit, Choler, Phlegm, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, to be the cauſes both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and conjunct of all Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, if they become contrary to Nature. So they will have Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Ulcers to be cauſed of ſalt Phlegm, <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> to be cauſed of aeruginous Choler; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous Ulcers of <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> which are the worſt and moſt deplorable of all others.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chymiſts</hi> on the other part, affirm that the Diſcourſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors doth not manifeſt unto us the Eſſence, and proper Nature of any Diſeaſe. So <hi>Quercetan</hi> in his advice of curing the Gout, brings in the Stone, which he affirms not to be ingendred of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Humors. <hi>Petrus Severinus</hi> the Dane in his <hi>Idea Medici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Although <hi>Galen</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times calls the Humors ſalt, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and aeruginous; yet the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> have no reaſon to reject the ordinary names of Humors, and to call contumeliouſly dogmatical Phyſicians Humoriſts, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any Diſeaſe to proceed from the ordinary Humors of the Body becoming unnatural: For ſeeing that according to <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>De loc. affect. c.</hi> 2. that is to be accounted the cauſe of a Grief, which being preſent, the Diſeaſe continueth, and which being removed, the Grief ceaſeth; and ſeeing we perceive Diſeaſes to be cauſed of vitious Humors abounding, and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expelled, the Grief to vaniſh, I ſee no reaſon why theſe Humors may not be accounted the true cauſes of Griefs; and that it is a meer folly, and an affection of novelty, to Baptize theſe by names of Minerals far fetched; as to call that which in Fevers is caſt up by vomit, rather Sulphur than Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Beſides this, the Chymiſts are injurious to dogmatical Phyſicians, in labouring to perſwade Men, that they by the name of a Humor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing elſe but a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſubſtance void of all other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; which ſhould be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Bodies, and the cauſes of all Diſeaſes: whereas every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Phyſician, by the term of a Humor, underſtands a liquid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52816:50"/>mixed with Blood: which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a ſeveral body of its own kind, and is more compound than water, ſo it has far more excellent qualities than water: The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians their own ſelves have ſet the <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> at work, while talking of Humors, and the cauſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, they ſo much talk of the firſt qualities, Heat, Cold, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and Dryneſs. For although ſundry Diſeaſes are cauſed of Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Dryneſs, yet we ſhall find other qualities in the Humor, which may as well hurt the Body as theſe: For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>De priſca Medicina,</hi> or ancient Phyſick, affirms, not that which is hot, cold, moiſt, or ſoft, to be moſt powerful, but that which is bitter, ſalt, ſweet, and ſowre, unſavoury, and ſharp, with ſome Sowerneſs; theſe and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in their Faculties, he will have to be the cauſes of Diſeaſes, and not the firſt qualities only: and from theſe the differences of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes in Fevers of this ſame kind do depend. Theſe whilſt they are exquiſitely mixed in the Body are harmleſs, yet when one of theſe is ſevered from the reſt, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in its quality, it manifeſts it ſelf, and annoys Man; ſo the corroſive Salt bewrays it ſelf in Cancers and corroſive Ulcers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be thought abſurd, that Minerals are in the Body of Man; for ſeeing Man is ſed by Plents, and Beaſts which ſeed alſo upon Plants; ſeeing alſo the Herbs have their Aliment from the ground, which is not alike in all places, but often is mingled with a ſalt Juyce, and other Mineral Spirits, which the Beaſts and Herbs cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convert into their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; one can hardly think that a Man can live upon theſe, and participate of no ſuch thing. So we ſee what variety of Wines the diverſity of Soils brings forth; and that in every Wine there is <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Argol,</hi> which appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very often in podagrical Perſons.

Wherefore <hi>Bertinus:</hi> in his Third Book and Eleventh of his Phyſick, doth raſhly and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately aſſirm, that not one whit of Mercury, Salt, or Sulphur, lies hid in the Body; for in the Itch, Scabbineſs, ſome Catarrhs, Inſlam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Eyes, and fretting Ulcers, it may be perceived; but in Urine, which is alſo an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Humor, the Salt may be ſeparated and preſented to the ſight: yea, beſides the Salt in Urine, another ſubſtance the cauſe of Diſeaſes may be marked: for if you take a clear Urine and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to ſettle, a Matter like unto the powder of Brick, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                     <p>Whoever ſhall go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the cauſes of all Diſeaſes to Blood, Choler, Melancholy, and Phlegm, ſhall wrap himſelf into a number of difficulties: I will deſire him to yield me a reaſon, Why he calls ſalt Phlegm ſo, ſeeing Phlegm is ſaid to be cold, but this hot? Why is <hi>Atra bilis</hi> comprehended under Melancholy, ſeeing it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot, but this cold? Beſides this, if any Phyſician go about to cure Diſeaſes, procured either by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, or Poiſon, he without any great reſpect to the Humors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently goes about to miniſter <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmica,</hi> as in the Plague, which is gotten by Contagion, to abate the force of it, and then he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to the preparation and evacuation of the Humors. If Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be miniſtred to any one in Meat or Drink, which according to <hi>Cardan,</hi> commenting upon the 62 <hi>Aphor.</hi> of the 4.

Let the Humors then which are ingendred in the Body, retain the accuſtomed names; but if an external cauſe make them degenerate from their Nature, let theſe be diſtinguiſhed from the ordinary, and have their denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that which altereth them. If Salt, Nitre, Alume, Vitriol, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe be mingled with any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, let it be called from the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mingled with it, ſalt, nitrous, aluminous, vitriolate or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. And for this cauſe ſome late judicious Phyſicians writing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign and peſtilent Fevers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their notable differences, have affirmed ſome to participate of the nature of Arſenick, ſome of Mercury, ſome of Hellebore, ſome of <hi>Opium,</hi> ſome of Leopards-bane, ſome of Hemlock; ſome to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the poyſon of a Viper, Scorpion, mad Dog and ſuch like, noting the variety of Symptoms in ſundry perſons.</p>
                     <p>One doubt remains concerning the Melancholick Humor, whether it be only thin and wateriſh, as <hi>Reuſnerus</hi> affirms in his Book of the Scurvy, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 4. out of ſundry places of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who calleth Melancholy <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as in his Book <hi>De morbis,</hi> and in his firſt Book <hi>De morbis Mulierum;</hi> or whether it be thick and earthy, according to the vulgar and received Opinion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this doubt be ſolved, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are to be premiſed. 1. In the Chyle there are two ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one liquid and thin, the other thick and terreſtrial, which can no more nouriſh than Aſhes. 2. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mingles theſe which are not ſent away by Stool, with part of the aqueous and ſuperfluous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, cauſed of Drink and liquid Meats. So in a Lie the Salt and ſome aduſt Parts are ſo mingled, that they are not diſcerned before ſeparation. I ſay then, that this thick and feculent Humor temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much moiſture, is to be accounted the ſuperfluous melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52816:51"/>cholick Humor, and that it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Spleen. For Firſt, Seeing this feculent Humor is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unapt to nouriſh, it muſt be ſeparated from the Chyle, which cannot be performed by any other part beſides the Spleen. Secondly, the Spleen is of a darker Red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour than the Liver is, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the thick, feculent, and terreſtrial Humor, which it imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. Thirdly, <hi>Hippocrates de aere, aq. &amp; loc.</hi> affirms, that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as dwell in Fenny places, are ſubject to paſſions of the Spleen. The cauſe is, becauſe the waters are not pure but muddy. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Spleen did draw only thin and wateriſh Humors, it could not be ſo ſubject to obſtructions as it is. The feculent Humor mixed with much Humidity, is the cauſe of ſundry Diſeaſes, the thin parts ſometimes aſcend to the upper parts, the groſs to the lower parts, as we ſee in the Scurvy, wherein the Gums are ulcerated, and the Legs tumefy. The Spleen being ſpongy, draws much Humidity to it, wherefore ſplenetick perſons ought to drink ſparingly; for if they bib too much, the natural heat of the part is eaſily oppreſſed, and ſo they become Hydropick. The wateriſh Humor of the Spleen is not inſipid, but ſharp and biting, and copious: ſo we ſee thoſe who are troubled with Quartanes, about the end of each Fit to ſweat plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; and thoſe who are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Melancholy, to ſpit much. In the thick, feculent, and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial blackiſh Matter, ſometimes there is no exceſs of the Spleen: in qualities ſometimes there is, and thoſe are two: <hi>Acerbitas,</hi> an aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſharpneſs, ſuch as appeareth is green unripe Fruits; and <hi>Acidit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So much I thought good to ſet down of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, to clear the doubts which are moved about it, and to ſhew one uſe of the Spleen.</p>
                     <p>To return then to the carbonary Cure of unlearned Alchymiſts, they object thus, The rational Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans affirm the Body to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the four Humors, How can they then be cauſes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes?</p>
                     <p>It is ſtrange that any Man ſhould wilfully ſhut the eye of the Mind (Underſtanding I mean) that they may not ſee Truth, ſeeing Man, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the very firſt words of the Book of his Metaphyſicks affirms, naturally covets knowledg, and our firſt Parents to their own and our loſs, are witneſſes. No dogmatical Phyſician ever affirmed any diſeaſe to be cauſed of any Humor of the Body, as long as it continues in its own natural eſtate; but then to ſtir up Griefs, when it is ſeparate from the reſt, when it putreſies, when forraign ſubſtances and qualities are added, which make it of a familiar Humor a profeſſed enemy to Health, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the natural conſtitution of the Body, a reſult of the laudable commixtion of the four Humors natural. I have inſiſted ſomewhat long in the ſetting down of the cauſes of Ulcers, becauſe he (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be) that goes about to cure Ulcers without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Cauſes, is like one, who being blind-folded, is ſet to thraſh a Cock.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the general Differences and Signs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw the fourth Point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the differences, and ſundry ſorts of Ulcers, offers it ſelf to be handled, and in Truth the courſe of Nature ſo requires: for the form of every particular Ulcer doth ſpring from the Cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of the ſame: for Example, a Cancer ulcerate is diſcerned from all other Ulcers by its proper and Pathognomonical Signs, all which, as effects, are aſcribed to <hi>Atra bilis,</hi> impacted in the part, the Cauſe conjunct of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Here of purpoſe I omit the idle and fruitleſs diſtinctions of Ulcers, ſet down by ſundry Authors, which neither better the underſtanding, nor further the Cure. Theſe only I will ſet down, which are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. The material differences then of Ulcers, are taken either from the Nature or Conſtitution of an Ulcer, or from the ſubject or part affected. From the Nature and Conſtitution, an Ulcer is either ſimple or compound.</p>
                     <p>In a ſimple Ulcer, nothing is offered which may ſtay the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon from going about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolldation of it, as the Cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, a cruel Symptom, Adjuncts, or ſome Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A compound Ulcer wherein either ſome of theſe, or all are found, which muſt be removed before Unition be procured, is either of the milder ſort, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign.</p>
                     <p>The more mild ſort of Ulcers yield to ordinary and uſual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, if they be judiciouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>The Malign yield not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides have fearful ſymptoms: thoſe Malign Ulcers proceed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from inward, or outward Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>From internal Cauſes ſpring a Cancer Ulcerate, <hi>Phagedaena, Nome,</hi> fretting Ulcers, and others which are called <hi>Chironia,</hi> or <hi>Telephia,</hi> which denominations inſinuate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto us concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Cure of an Ulcer, but bring only unto our Memory the Names of thoſe who are celebrated by Poets, which belong more to Grammarians than Phyſicians or Chirurgeons to be known.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Ulcers, are two, to wit, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium,</hi> Contagion, or a venemous quality, Vapor, or Humor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the name of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum,</hi> or Poiſon.</p>
                     <p>The Differences taken from the Subject or Part affected are two,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52816:52"/>for either an Ulcer poſſeſſes the outward part, and is called <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> or outward; or it afflicts the inner parts, and is named <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> or inward. Other differences taken from the continuance, figure and quantity, are here impertinent, and further only predictions, of which I will ſpeak in the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the ſigns of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; an internal Ulcer is found out and diſcerned by the Excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Matter expelled. As for Example, if the Urine be purulent, we conjecture the Kidnies or Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ulcerate. If purulent Matter be voided by coughing, it is like that the Lungs are ulcerate; if much of ſuch Matter be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſigns of an Apoſtem have gone before, it is an apoſtematous Ulcer; if the purulent Matter be but little, and no ſigns of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlammation have been noted, then it is but a primary Ulcer proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eroſion, by reaſon of a ſharp Humor ſeparating the unity of the ſubſtance of the Lungs. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ulcers I will leave to the conſideration of Phyſicians, unto whom they are moſt commonly preſented to be cured. Only I will ſet down ſuch things as tend to the cure of Ulcers of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts. I need not to buſie my ſelf about ſetting down of the general ſigns of ſuch, ſeeing they are preſented to the view of the Chirurgeon by the parts grieved. Only let me give you warning, that you miſtake not a Wound for an Ulcer: into this errour you may eaſily fall, if you admit the moſt ordinary deſcription of an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, ſtrange even to judicious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Chirurgeons; which is, that it is a Solution of continuity in a fleſhy part, yielding Quittour; it matters not, they think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be laudable or illaudable. It is ſet down that there ſhould be ſet down no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Wound and an Ulcer, than this, that the one is bloody, and the other purulent. Doth not, I pray you, a Wound become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent of it ſelf, although no Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon deal with it, and may not an Ulcer become bloody if Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be uſed, as it may daily be ſeen? Frivolous it is alſo in my judgment, that a Solution of Unity inflicted by an Inſtrument that woundeth in a Bone, as a Sword, may be called a Wound; and that a Solution of Unity in a Bone, procured by an eroding Humor, may not be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>Seeing the Cauſes conjunct make the true differences of an Ulcer and Wound: which are an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inſtrument dividing, and a ſharp Humor eroding, the parts; Who can imagine that in a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Ulcer, wherein there is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Bone, there ſhould be two ſorts of Ulcers ſpecifically differing, to wit, one in the fleſhy part, and another in the Bone, the ſame Humor cauſing both?</p>
                     <p>But a Solution of Unity in the Bone by a corroding Humor is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Terede,</hi> ſay they.</p>
                     <p>What then? Muſt a Malign Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Face, becauſe it is called <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted out of the liſt of cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ulcers?</p>
                     <p>No. Let this then be accounted an undoubted Truth, that a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity procured in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52816:52"/>Body by a Humor eroding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the Fleſh or Bone, may be, yea ought to be, called an Ulcer, as a Solution by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument ſeparating is called a Wound in both.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the general Prognoſticks of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe next thing I ſhall proceed upon concerning Ulcers is their general Prognoſticks. The conſideration of theſe will make one circumſpect, when an Ulcer is offered to him to be cured, in the election of his Cure: for whoever takes in hand a grief uncurable, he diſcredits himſelf, and cauſes the Art to be contemned by thoſe who are ſimple and ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Error of the Practicer to the inſufficiency of the Art. Let this be the firſt prediction: an Ulcer in a Body of an evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, which may be conjectured by the colour of the Skin, if it be of a tallowy whiteneſs, yellow or ſwarthiſh, is not eaſily cured: for it is likely, that corrupt Phlegm, Vitellin Choler, and feculent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy do abound, which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors hinder the regeneration of Fleſh: but on the contrary, an Ulcer is eaſily cured in a perſon of a good complexion, who digeſts well and does not increaſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſluous moiſture. II. Ulcers in Bodies which are either very moiſt or dry, are hardly cured. This is plain in the Bodies of Hydropical perſons, and thoſe who are aged; for as ſuperfluous Humidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to deſiccation hinders the healing in thoſe firſt: So in the latter the defect of Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is an impediment. III. Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in Children by reaſon of their exceſſive Humidity, and in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, becauſe the moſt laudable part of the Blood is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nouriſhment of the Child, are not eaſily cured. IV. Ulcers which fall out after critical Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems in the Sphondyls of the back, or great joynts of the Body, for the moſt part are mortal: becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſickneſs, and Apoſtemation Nature muſt be exceedingly weakned, the Natural Heat much abated, and the Radical Moiſture almoſt ſpent. Such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtems do fall out when as ſharp Fevers end not critically in the decretory days by ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation, as Bleeding at the Noſe, Vomiting, Sweating, Purging by Stool and Urine, but extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the fortieth day. V. If the place wherein the Ulcer is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be blackiſh, blewiſh, or greeniſh, it hardly can be cured: for the Blood muſt be naughty, and the fleſh corrupt. VI. Ulcers with a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52816:53"/>round figure are cured with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; the reaſon is this, Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is procured by unition of the parts; the farther the parts are aſunder, the more ſlowly it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: but a round Figure, of all other within the ſame bounds, is moſt ample. VII. Painful Ulcers in Children are dangerous, becauſe their Bodies being raw, and the Spirits ſubtil, they are eaſily ſpent, which is the cauſe that they are much weakned, and ſo diſpoſed for death it ſelf. VIII. If an Ulcer become either blewiſh or pale, the party being ill, death is not far off; for theſe colours in the Natural Moiſture ſhew the Mortification of the part; and drineſs ſhews, that is gone. IX. If an Ulcer be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate with a Diſeaſe which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, the Ulcer, according to the Nature of the Diſeaſe, is either of eaſie or hard cure. So a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Ulcer in a ſucculent and ſtrong Body is eaſily cured, but if the party be in a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> neither the Ulcer nor the Diſeaſe can be cured: Becauſe the uſe of the deſiccatives, which only avail in theſe Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will only haſten death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the extenuation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: In like manner Ulcers in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick and Hydropick perſons are hardly cured, in theſe becauſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Humidity hinders Deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Ulcer; in thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe laudable juyce flows not to the part ulcerate. X. If Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in Ulcers ſuddenly vaniſh without any evident and manifeſt Cauſe, as Bleeding, or application of a diſcuſſive Medicament, they portend no good; but Convulſions, if they appear in the hinder parts, becauſe the <hi>Spina</hi> is very Nervous; and Madneſs, Pleuriſie or Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if they were red, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the forepart. XI. Soft Tumors in Ulcers are laudable, becauſe they will yield to Medicaments; but hard, not eaſie to be cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Humor is more rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. XII. If the Hairs fall in places of the Body about the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, it is an evil ſign: For then there muſt be great Acrimony, and Corruption of the Humors, as in quartane Agues, the Pox, and Leproſie. XIII. If in an Ulcer where there is Carioſity of the Bone, the colour of the Fleſh be livid, the party muſt be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for it is a ſign of extinction of the Natural Heat. XIV. Ulcers that afford Quittour which is white, ſmooth, and uniform, and not ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, promiſe an eaſie cure; for theſe qualities in the Quittour ſhew the dominion of the Natural Heat, and the ſoundneſs of the ſolid parts. XV. A Flux of Blood coming in an Ulcer after ſtrong pulſation is ominous, according to <hi>Hippocrates, ſect.</hi> 7. <hi>Aph.</hi> 21. for there muſt be a ſtrong Phlegmon, and the Arteries muſt be much preſſed, ſo that a Gangrene may be expected: however, of ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Blood no Fleſh can be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. XVI. If an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Bone being bare, it is no good ſign, <hi>Hippocrat. Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 19. for Fleſh cannot be regenerate by ſuch a ſharp Humor as this, that cauſeth ſo hot a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. XVII. From malign Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers two ſorts of Quittour flow; One thin, and it is called <hi>Ichor</hi> or <hi>Sanies;</hi> ſuch a virulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſues alſo from the pricking of the Nerves, and corruption of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52816:53"/>
                        <hi>Perioſteon.</hi> The other ſort of Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is thick, and is called <hi>Sordes.</hi> XVIII. In Ulcers which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Twelve-month or longer, the Bone muſt be ſcaled, and the skinning be hollow, <hi>Hip. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Aph.</hi> 45. But to make good this Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſome conditions are to be required: The Firſt is, that much Fleſh above the Bone be not in the part ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Secondly, the Humor which flows to the part muſt be very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive. Thirdly, it muſt not have been dealt withal by any Phyſician or Chirurgeon. If one or more of theſe Conditions fail, the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm muſt miſs of its prediction. What <hi>Galen</hi> and late Writers have ſet down in the explication of this Aphoriſm, clears not the truth of it: only theſe Conditions ſet down by me do. The ſigns which lead you to the knowledge of a Bone corrupted, are theſe. 1. If the Ulcer, having been skinned, breaks out again: for it is likely that the Bone caſts out an ichorous ſubſtance, which is the cauſe of this recidivation. 2. If the Ulcer yield more and thinner Matter than the bigneſs of it requires. 3. If the brims of the Ulcer will not come in. 4. If the brims become reddiſh. 5. If the Bone, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Sight, appear rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and of a blackiſh colour, not ſmooth, or a ruddy white colour. XIX. Whatſoever Ulcers caſt out much <hi>Sanies</hi> or ichorous Matter, which is too thin, of a leady, pale, or black colour; or glutinous, or ſtinking, and which frets the Skin adjacent, are hard to be cured, for this Humor keeps the Ulcer moiſt, and cannot eaſily be dryed, even if you apply powerful Topicks. XX. Inveterate Ulcers which caſt out a Quittour called by the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clans <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>like unto white Oil,</hi> are hardly cured; for this ſignifies a colliquation of the part, and an extenuation of the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>

                        <p>Of the general Cure of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, and their Times.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Univerſal Cure of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers is compriſed in this one Propoſition: <hi>All <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire deſiccation,</hi> So <hi>Hippoc. in princ. lib. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer. &amp; Galen. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Method. c.</hi> 3. for whether we go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender Fleſh, or to ſeal up an Ulcer by cicatriſation, deſiccative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſtill required.</p>
                     <p>There are four times to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Ulcers.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Principium,</hi> The beginning; In it the Quittour is thin and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Augmentum,</hi> the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; In it the Quittour flows more ſparingly, and thicker.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Status,</hi> The conſiſtence; In it there is no ichorous Matter but <hi>Pus,</hi> yet it appears ſomewhat thinner.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Declinatio,</hi> When the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is on the mending hand; then laudable <hi>Pus</hi> ſhews it ſelf. It is white, being altered by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temperature of the Veins, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries Nerves and Membranes, whoſe ſubſtance is white. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is uniform, not grumous, or cruddy, natural heat working equally upon every part of it. Thirdly, It is without all ill ſmell, ſeeing the natural heat has correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the evil qualities of it.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of Ulcers is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two means; The Firſt, is the removing of the Cauſes antecedent. The Second, is the artificial dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes antecedent are four, <hi>Cacochymia, Contagium, Venenum,</hi> and the diſtemperature of the part.</p>
                     <p>The ill habit of the Body is to be removed by alteration and evacuation, if an Humor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
                     <p>Contagion is to be overcome by <hi>Alexipharmaca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Poiſon is to be contemperate by <hi>Antidota.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The diſtemperature of the part is to be removed by things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it. And that we may the more eaſily attain to theſe ſcopes, a convenient order of Diet muſt ever be preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe conjunct, which is the eroding Humor, that is ſetled in the part, is ſurpriſed by ſuch Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſuit the four times of an Ulcer before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning then Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives or Digeſtives are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Firſt, becauſe the Matter which has left the Veſſels, and has inſinuated it ſelf within the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities, putrefies: wherefore it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52816:54"/>ought to be concocted, that it may become laudable Quittour.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, good Fleſh cannot be procured by ſarcotical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unleſs the Matter be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; For ſo the Ulcer is made apt to admit the Generation of Fleſh. Theſe Suppuratives ought in the firſt qualities to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the temperature of the part to which they are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; ſo to parts hot in the Firſt or Second Degree, Suppuratives hot in the ſame degrees are to be applied: for if they exceed, they are ſo far from ſtrengthening the natural heat, that they rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, making it Aguiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural: if the part be temperate, let temperate Suppuratives be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>But Digeſtives ought not to be applyed, Firſt, to putrid Ulcers: for ſeeing Suppuratives are hot and moiſt, if they ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, they would cauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are not fit for Rheumatick Ulcers; for ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments relax the part, and make it more ſubject to receive the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that flows, and ſo a Tumor might be cauſed. And ſince Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puratives are to be applied to the parts ulcerate, becauſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which is hot and ſharp, would inflame the part, if it were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated and cleanſed: So repelling Topicks are to be applyed to the parts about the Ulcer, to repell the Matter which flows.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the heat of the Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Medicament draw nothing from the parts adjacent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To ſtrengthen the parts, that they may reſiſt Fluxion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe by the repelling of the Humor, the deſiccation of the Ulcer is furthered.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe the heat of the part ulcerate is intended and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, it being kept in by the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of repelling Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>And for as much as I affirm, that Ulcers always require deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not amiſs to mix with Suppuratives ſome driers; yet, that in the beginning the Suppuratives have the upper hand, but in the end the Deſiccatives.</p>
                     <p>After that the Ulcer is well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and yields laudable Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, Mundificatives are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: for if you apply ſarcotical Medicaments, before the Ulcer is well digeſted, ſpongy and naughty Fleſh will grow, which will admit of no cicatrization. In mundify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we muſt not uſe too ſharp Medicaments, for theſe may cauſe an unskilful Phyſician or Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to believe that it is a corroſive Ulcer. The pain which the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent feels in the part ulcerate will bewray this error. Theſe three ſcopes being compaſſed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Cauſe conjunct, nothing remains but to ſeal up the Cure by Cicatrization.</p>
                     <p>Seeing moſt ordinary Ulcers proceed from Fluxion, it is to be withſtood, Firſt, by Revulſion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by Repulſion. In Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein the Matter is drawn to parts far diſtant, the rectitude of the part and veſſels is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. So if the Ulcer be in the Right Leg, Revulſion is to be procured in the Right Arm, if you reſpect the rectitude of the part; but if you conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of the veſſels, Revulſion is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52816:55"/>to be uſed in the Left Leg, if the Ulcer be in the Right: for ſo the communion of veſſels is kept.</p>
                     <p>Revulſion is performed by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives, and theſe are three; Heat, Pain, and the ſhunning of Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hot things which procure At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, are hot Inunctions, and Baths: ſtrait Ligatures cauſe pain; but both pain and heat are cauſed by Ventoſes, and Veſicatories. Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanels attract by reaſon of the ſhunning of Vacuity; for they ſending out ſtill ſome ſubſtance, ſome other muſt be drawn to fill up the place of that.</p>
                     <p>Repulſion, wherein the Humor is ſtaied in its paſſage, is performed by applying thoſe Medicaments which commonly are called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſives: theſe Medicaments are aſtringent and cold, and rather dry than moiſt in Ulcers. Now that you may know whether you proceed according to Art in the curing of Ulcers, receive this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: <hi>When Medicaments apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers do good, or at leaſt hurt not, it is a ſign that they are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; but if they do harm, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer hotter or colder, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or moiſter than is fit, then you may gather that ſuch are to be changed, and their contraries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude this Point, nine things make Ulcers hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Medicaments befitting <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in general, and Firſt of repelling Medicaments.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not unknown how many ſawcy and malepert Empericks there are in <hi>London,</hi> who baſely and irreverently ſpeak of thoſe who are skilful indeed, and deſerve well of the Art of Chirurgery, (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing unto it credit, and to their own ſelves profit and renown, by their methodical and ſucceſsful practice) and ſo impudently boaſt of their Secrets, and exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as if they had no Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. That you may be the more able, not only to encounter with theſe conſident Cowards; but to overthrow them alſo, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, according to that talent of Skill which I have, to furniſh you with competent, both Theorie and Practice. It is a ſhame for a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon not to be furniſhed with admirable variety of Medicaments; ſeeing Nature hath been ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for him. Turn your Eyes whither you will, and behold the fertility of Nature, and you ſhall ſee and find that in her Works ſhe has not been unmindful of you. As for Plants, you have <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> yea all who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them, witneſſes; that the greateſt part of them have fallen to your ſhare. As for the things which lye hid in the bowels of the Earth, as Metals, Spirits, Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, do they not ſerve your turn? The Metals for your inſtruments, the reſt for your Medicaments. Let no Man think then, that a skilful and induſtrious Chirurgeon can by his Art, perform no other Cures, but ſuch as may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by the compoſitions in his Salvatory. Theſe he muſt have in readineſs, other Medicaments he is able to fetch out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Nature, which he has at his Command. This I will make good by ſetting down only thoſe Medicaments, which are known to belong to the cure of Ulcers. Of theſe there are two Orders or Ranks: for ſome ſerve for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ulcers, ſome for thoſe which have a Malignity annexed. Thoſe that ſerve for ordinary Ulcers, are of five ſorts, for ſome are Repelling, ſome Digeſting, ſome Mundifying, ſome Incarnating, and ſome Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing, and the Medicaments which perform theſe Offices, are either ſimple or compound.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The Simples Repelling are theſe that follow.</head>
                        <p>Of theſe, ſome are of an Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubſtance, as Water it ſelf,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52816:56"/>Lettuce, all ſorts of Succory, Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, Horſe-tail, Periwinckle, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Comfrey, Purſlain, Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Houſleek, theſe four yield not their Juyce eaſily; wherefore they muſt be beaten in a Mortar, and ſome Verjuyce, Vinegar, or joyce of Quinces mingled with them. There be ſome Simples not ſo wateriſh as theſe are, as Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Milfoil, Vine-Leaves, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Red Wine, Verjuyce, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, the fruit of the Berbery, the fruit of the Quicken-beam, Sloes, Myrtle-berries, Pomegranate-rinds and Flowers infuſed in Red Wine, which is aſtringent, Tanners Wooſe, which will be more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if theſe Simples together with Red-Roſe Leaves dried, be boiled a little in it; but the Wooſe muſt be taken when it is newly made, and before any Leather be put in it. The Leaves and Apples of the Mandrake, the Henbane, the Leaves of <hi>Stramonea,</hi> black Poppy, and deadly Nightſhade are more cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the former; but they muſt be left before the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come livid, or of a Leady colour. If you uſe the Juyces or Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the aforeſaid Simples, which you ſhall be enforced to do, if the cure of Ulcers and Wounds be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto you, being in the Countrey, where no Apothecary is, by whom you can be furniſhed with Medicaments which are fit to repel, then you muſt apply to the parts adjacent to the Ulcer, Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of Wooll or Tow moiſtned in them; then above theſe Stupes of linnen or woollen Cloaths, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temperature of the Party, and the ſeaſon of the year, moiſtned in the ſame and wrung, are to be applied.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all, the part ulcerate is handſomly to be rowled, the Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler having been moiſtned in theſe Juyces or Decoctions. One thing is to be noted, that it is the beſt courſe ſtill to mingle ſome Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents with thoſe which have a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh juice: for as theſe cool beſt, and repreſs the Fluxion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; ſo theſe by wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Skin repel more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. As you rowl up Fractures, ſo muſt you rowl Parts Ulcerate. Of this kind of rowling I will ſpeak in its proper place.</p>

                        <p>When theſe ſigns of ſufficient Mundification appear, then you muſt go about incarnating of the Ulcer.

Nature when ſhe is in her vigor, cannot totally convert the Aliment into the ſubſtance of the ſolid parts, but after ſhe has had a care of the preſervation of them, hath a task to expel both a wateriſh or thin, and a thick Excrement by the pores of the Skin to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of it, (as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Morphew,) when ſhe is diſabled by a Solution of Unity; much leſs can ſhe effect her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whereof the thin Excrement a humid Ulcer is procured; but of the thick a ſordid. Wherefore if you will go about to cure an Ulcer, you muſt labor to dry the humid Ulcers by deſiccatives, and the ſordid by Mundificatives; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all Solution of Unity Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ever vigilant and buſie, and in Ulcers to regenerate fleſh, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of which work theſe two Excrements muſt be ſeparated; it is manifeſt that there cannot be one moment deſigned in the curing of Ulcers, where drying and mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying Medicaments are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

                        <p>As for the ſecond, ſeeing always in skinning there is leſt a greater cavity in the middle, than about the brims of the Ulcer, ſtronger deſiccatives are to be applied to the brims; but milder to the middle, that the Fleſh be not too ſoon dried. Wherefore Powders and Cerots are to be applied to the brims, but only Cerots or Unguents to the middle. When you have cicatrized an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer by Methodical proceeding, there be ſome perſons who will not reſt ſo contented; as Ladies (who make much of their Skins) and Whores (who gain much by theirs) but will deſire to have the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> made by any means ſomewhat beautiful to the Eye.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the cure of a plain and hollow <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, being Simple.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving paſſed thorow the ten Points whereof I intended to write, before I was to meddle with the Cure of any particular Ulcer; now it is time to ſet down the Method of Cure of Ulcers in particular. I would have you to call to remembrance the material differences of Ulcers delivered by me in the third Chapter, which were taken either from the Nature and Conſtitution of an Ulcer, or from the parts affected: from the Nature of the Ulcer I deduced two forts of them; ſome I called Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome Compound. Now the Simple Ulcer is to be accounted ſuch an one, as hath neither a Diſeaſe, Cauſe, or Symptom an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, or complicate, beſides the Solution of Unity cauſed by Eroſion. Of theſe ſimple Ulcers there are two kinds; for ſome are plain and equal to the natural Skin, wherein only the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and <hi>Cutis</hi> are loſt. Some are hollow, <hi>cava,</hi> wherein, beſides the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and the <hi>Cutis,</hi> a part of the Fleſh is loſt. It is not needful ſeverally to ſet down the Cure of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcus planum,</hi> or <hi>aequale,</hi> a plain, or even Ulcer; becauſe in proſecuting the Indications of cure of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcus cavum,</hi> a hollow Ulcer, I muſt ſet down the means of curing a plain one: for this is contained as a part in the other.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then there are two affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in a hollow Ulcer, to wit, Solution of Unity and Cavity; three ſcopes of Cure offer themſelves, Unition, Incarnation, and Clcatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation. Wherefore if the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour be white, ſmooth, ſmall in quantity, reaſonable thick, and not evil ſmelling: If beſides the Ulcer it ſelf be red, and ſenſible, then we may go about to ingender Fleſh, by applying Sarcotical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But on the contrary, if the <hi>Pus</hi> be black, uneven, grumous, rough and ſtinking, and if the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer it ſelf be not red and ſenſible, the Ulcer cannot be incarnate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be prepared by Suppuratives and Mundificatives. Beſides <hi>Pus,</hi> which is reaſonable thick, three ſorts of Excrements appear in Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is thin, and wateriſh, like to Water wherein Fleſh has been waſhed: this has received no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but has flowed pure, as it is in the Veins and Fleſh; and is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52816:60"/>called <hi>Ichor.</hi> The ſecond is thin too, but it has received ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the temperature of the part; this is called <hi>Sanies</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> The third is very thick and glutinous, and is called <hi>Sordes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Excrements which are thin, moiſten the part ulcerate, that it cannot ſufficiently diſcharge it ſelf by breathing out the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore Deſiccatives are to be uſed, to conſume this ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture: but the Excrements which are thick cleave to the part, and hinder the addition of Fleſh. Theſe are obviated by Abſterſives or Mundificatives. The Ulcer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared by Suppuratives and Mundificatives, you are to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fleſh by incarnating Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There are two Cauſes of this Fleſh, which is to be procured. 1. Is the efficient Cauſe: This is Nature it ſelf, not only of the whole Body, but of the part it ſelf alſo, which is called <hi>Temperies,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temperature or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: whereby it attracts, concocts, applies and aſſimilates the nouriſhment to it ſelf. 2. Is the material Cauſe: this is ſincere and pure Blood. If the part ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate enjoy ſuch, then nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but to maintain it: If the Blood be not pure, then it is to be altered; if it be too hot, it is to be cooled; if too cold, it is to be warmed; if it be too thin, it is to be thickned; if it be too thick, it is to be attenuated; if there be too great plenty of it, it is to be diminiſhed; if it be too little, then it is to be increaſed by convenient order of Dyet.</p>
                     <p>To come nearer to the Cure of of a ſimple Ulcer: Firſt, we muſt diſcreetly order thoſe things which are called <hi>not natural:</hi> ſeeing a convenient Dyet preſerves and maintains the good Conſtitution of the whole Body, and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the part. Wherefore all thoſe Meats and Drinks that make the Blood too hot, too ſharp, too thin, or too thick, are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and thoſe only to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which afford good Juice, and are of eaſie concoction, eſpecially if the diſeaſed party be tender and weak. Beſides this, they muſt be taken moderately, and at conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times. The part it ſelf muſt be kept quiet; for motion heats the part. Care alſo is to be had of ſleeping and watching: for as watching dries the Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes ſuperfluous humidity, ſo ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moiſtens the parts; but thoſe chiefly which are nervous or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy, as Membranes, Tendons and Ligaments. If then the Ulcer be humid, enjoyn watching; if it be dry, command ſleeping. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vacuation of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let it be appointed, that they may anſwer in quantity the Food which the diſeaſed party takes. If he proves coſtive, either miniſter unto him a Clyſter, or give him an ounce of <hi>Electuarium lenitivum</hi> in Chicken Broth. As perturbations of the Mind change the ſtate of the whole Body, ſo the tranquillity of it maintains the ſame. A ſpecial care is to be had of the Air; for it wonderfully preſerves the temperature of the part. Southerly and Northerly winds are not fit for Ulcers: for as the firſt moiſtens and heats, ſo the ſecond doth much cool and dry: but cold is an Enemy to Ulcers. So it is obſerved
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52816:60"/>that the Air in <hi>Angien</hi> is hurtful to Ulcers in the Legs, but in <hi>Paris</hi> good. So in <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> it is hurtful; but in <hi>Florence</hi> wholeſome.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of the ſimple Ulcers: If I ſhould ſet down any, you might juſtly think I did abuſe the time; for there is none ſo ſimple, who may not gather out of the very denomination of them, that they are moſt eaſie to be cured, and that great skill is not required to compaſs the ſame: only let me give you warning that the Cure may be either more eaſie or hard, according to the Nature of the part ulcerate, and the Dyet of the Patient. So ſimple Ulcers are more eaſily cured in a fleſhy part, than in a Joynt or a Nervous part; for in theſe ſtronger Deſiccatives are required, and in them the natural Heat is not ſo powerful to make uſe of the Medicaments applied. In like manner a ſimple Ulcer is more eaſily cured in the Body of a temperate perſon, than it is in the Body of one given to debauchery. Having ſet down the right uſe of the things not natural, as Dyet, Sleeping and Watching, evacuation of the Excrements, the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind and Air; I ſhall ſet down ſome local Medicaments for the accompliſhing of the Cure of theſe Ulcers, according to the general Indications of Cure, ſet down in the fifth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>As for the Digeſting, Mundify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Incarnating of a ſimple Ulcer, if it be hollow, theſe Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Scopes ſhall be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Application of my <hi>Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi> The deſcription of it is this; ℞ <hi>Cerae &amp; Reſin. an.</hi> ℥ vj. <hi>Picis Navalis</hi> ℥ iv. <hi>Gummi Elemi</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Ol.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum populeum</hi> mingled together, you ſhall prevent Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>When you have fill'd an hollow ſimple Ulcer with fleſh, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but to cover it. Now the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Fleſh is the Skin it ſelf: and as the Fleſh loſt is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, ſo is that which covers it. But ſeeing the Skin is framed in the Womb of a ſeminal Matter, it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, cannot be reſtored, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the defect of Matter: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt find out another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This cover is called by Artiſts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52816:61"/>
                        <hi>Cicatrix.</hi> This is nothing elſe but the uppermoſt <hi>Superſicies</hi> of the Fleſh ſo dried, that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Skin. And as in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring of good Fleſh in an Ulcer laudable Blood was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Cauſe of it, ſo good Fleſh is the material Cauſe of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Cicatrix</hi> is procured by three means; by Nature it ſelf, the Air, and epulotical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That Nature has an hand in this Buſineſs it doth appear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways: for we may ſee daily Ulcers skinned with theſe ſame Medicaments by Empirlcks, which they uſed in incarnating, ſo that Nature muſt be the chief effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe. Secondly, many times a Scab covers ſuch Ulcers being incarnate, which being removed, or falling away of it ſelf, the place appears skinned. Only Nature is the cauſe of this; for no Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was applied. Thirdly, if Nature had not a hand in this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſuch an order would not be obſerved, that the brims of the Ulcer ſhould firſt be skinned, and then the middle. Fourthly, Nature works in her actions to the period appointed: ſo in an Ulcer ſhe not being hindred fills the Ulcer with Fleſh, even unto the uppermoſt <hi>Superficies;</hi> which being done, ſhe ceaſes from affording any more Matter of Fleſh; whereby it comes to paſs, that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Superficies,</hi> being deprived of further nouriſhment, muſt become dry.</p>
                     <p>What power the Air has, doth manifeſtly appear in the Bodies of Infants newly born; their whole Skin is ſoft and red; the cold Air afterward repels the Bloood, dried the Skin, and makes it more hard.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing Nature very often in ſuch an action proves ſlow, ſo that if you would wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon her, and expect her lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, you ſhould ſeem of purpoſe to protract time, and be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe your Patient, it is the ſafeſt and beſt courſe to aid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by aſſiſting her with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and good epulotical or skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Medicaments. In the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of Ancient and Modern Writers one ſhall find great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof notwithſtanding a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and judicious choice muſt be had, if he mean to make good uſe of them; for I dare be bold to affirm, that there are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deſcriptions of Medicaments, whereof the firſt deſcribers never made any trial, but ſet them down, being induced only by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And amongſt theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, you ſhall find not a ſmall number, which are either ridiculous, or ſuperſtitious, or both. Seeing then the caſe ſtands thus, I will only commend unto you three Medicaments fit for skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſimple Ulcers: The firſt is, <hi>Diapalma cum Succis.</hi> The ſecond my <hi>Epuloticum,</hi> which I deſcribed in the former Chapter.

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter, I ſet down what did belong to the Cure of ſimple Ulcers, as well plain as hollow, wherein no other offence beſides the loſs of the Skin and Fleſh is found. Hereafter I am in like manner to write of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Ulcers, wherein beſides So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ution of Unity, cauſed by Eroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is ſomewhat elſe that hinders the conſolidation of the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated part.</p>
                     <p>Theſe compound Ulcers are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the milder ſort, or elſe Malign. Thoſe of the milder ſort, have annexed either a Diſeaſe, or a Cauſe, or Symptoms, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chirurgeon from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Unition of the part ulcerate. Sundry Diſeaſes in the Body of Man may keep Ulcers from heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſome corrupting the Humors, as the Leproſie and Pox: I mean the <hi>French;</hi> ſome hindering of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Blood in ſufficient quantity to be ſent, as <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> and a Hectick Fever: ſome by ſending too much wateriſh Humidity with Blood hinder the Unition of the part ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated. If Ulcers in ſuch perſons be preſented to you to be cured, you are ſeriouſly to ponder in your mind, how hard a task is put upon you, if any of the former Diſeaſes be complicate with the Ulcers, if you only except the French-pox in a reaſonable ſtrong Body. But if the Body of one troubled with the French-pox be extenuate much, then permit the Cure of him alſo amongſt the reſt, to the charge of ſuch as are only <gap reason="foreign">

Seeing the practice of Phyſick and Chirurgery are ſevered in <hi>England,</hi> I hold it to be the ſafeſt courſe for you to leave the Cure of Diſeaſes to learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and to aſſume only to your
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52816:62"/>ſelves the methodical dreſſing of Ulcers: for ſo the whole diſcredit, (if any redound) will fall to the Phyſicians ſhare, who cured not the grief, the only hindrance of the cure of the Ulcer. This is my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, If an Ulcer complicate with a dangerous Diſeaſe, come at any time to your handling: (It is not your deſire, I know, that I ſhould ſet down the manner of Cure of any inward diſeaſe: for then I ſhould be be buſie with my Sicle in the harveſt of other Men) that then in this caſe you have recourſe unto ſome Author who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moſt Learnedly of the manner of curing that Diſeaſe which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Ulcer, and follow his Indications in dealing with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, if you have not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a Phyſician, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you may follow.</p>

                     <p>From a diſeaſe joyned to an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, I will deſcend to the cauſes hindring the cure of an Ulcer. Theſe are two: the Humors that ſlow, and the diſtemperature of the part.</p>
                     <p>As for the Humor, if it be in ſlowing, then you are to obviate it with ordering the things called <hi>not natural;</hi> as Air, Meat and Drink, Sleeping and Watching, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation and ſuch like, and by Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Humor offending; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake ſufficiently in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Tumors. If it hath flowed to the part, and be impacted in it, then it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by three means; to wit, by drying, expreſſing, and removing of the cauſes of the Fluxion.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall dry the Hunior, if you uſe ſarcotical Medicaments drying at the leaſt in the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as Bones calcined, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn calcined, and made up in Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſces with Plantain, and Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, <hi>Aes uſtum,</hi> the Pumice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone calcined, <hi>Calaminaris, Borax,</hi> the powders of Tormentil, Biſtort, Comfrey, and ſuch like; whereof I have ſpoken ſufficiently before; yet <hi>Nunquam ſatis dieitur qual nunquam ſat is diſcitur,</hi> a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52816:62"/>can never be too much pointed at; ſo fluxible and gliding are the objects of our memory.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall expreſs the Humors: Firſt, by uſing ſuch repelling Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments as I have often ſpoken of, which are to be applied to the parts adjacent to the Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by rowling the Ulcer, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſcribes in his Treatiſe of Fractures, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin about the Ulcer, uſing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny revolutions, or windings of the Rowler, as are fit, and ending in the ſound part.</p>
                     <p>As for the cauſes of Fluxion, they are three; Tranſmiſſion, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and the furious motion of the Humor it ſelf. A part ſends, either moved by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of the Humor, or urged by an offending quality, or both. If the Humor offend in quantity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, then it is to be abated by Phlebotomy, Purging, ſlender Diet, and ſuch means as have been delivered by me in the Treatiſe of Tumors, to leſſen plenitude, or <hi>Pletbora,</hi> the ſigns whereof I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered there alſo, ſo that I need not to repeat them here. If the Humor offend in quality, urging and pricking the part to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of it, as the Liver, which being tainted with the French Pox, ſends the Humor to the Groins, Yard, <hi>Matrix,</hi> the Fundament and Throat. When we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and noted the quality and nature of the Humor, then we are to go about the expulſion, or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, or both.</p>
                     <p>If the Humor offend both in quantity and quality, then are we to uſe both purging and altering. Now to find out the Humors in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity offending, ſeeing I have ſet down their Pathognomonical and proper ſigns, when I diſcourſed of every ſpecial Tumor, I will remit you to the places where they were ſet down. If Humors do flow by reaſon of the attraction of the part, it is procured either by the heat, or the pain of the part. If a Humor flow to the Ulcer, neither being ſent from a part, nor received by a part, but becauſe the Humor it ſelf is eliquate, either by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement perturbations of the Mind, or an aguiſh Conſtitution, or the exhibition of an eradicative or ſtrong Medicament: then the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Mind is to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the aguiſh heat to be abated, and the exhibition of ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments to be ſtayed. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the fluxion of Humors ſo much as is fit for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, now I am to touch briefly the other cauſe of mild, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Ulcers, to wit, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the part.</p>
                     <p>The ſingle diſtemperatures are in number four, to wit, too dry, too moiſt, too hot, too cold. A dry diſtemperature is found out by theſe ſigns: the colour of the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate part is ill-ſavoured, not live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, little or no Matter flows from it. in touching it ſeems hard and dry.</p>
                     <p>This diſtemperature is removed by two means: Firſt, by drawing out the natural Humidity to the part affected, by opening the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which before by reaſon of immoderate dryneſs were drawn together. In this caſe Friction is excellent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, dryneſs is removed by the application of humecting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. Two ſuch are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52816:63"/>by the Ancients pure Spring-water, and Water and Oyl mingled together.</p>
                     <p>As for the uſe of Spring or River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, it muſt be applied luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, not very hot; for if it be very hot, it diſcuſſes; becauſe the Humors having been attenuate by it, they are turned into vapours, and ſo reſolved: but if it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately hot, and the part foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, it moiſtens.</p>
                     <p>The Second Medicament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Water and Oyl, by the Ancients is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The ulcerate part immoderately dry, is to be fomented with this Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment warm: Take either two parts of Water and one of Oyl, or equal; warm them in a ſingle Vial-glaſs, then ſhake them well together that they may be mingled, and apply the Medicament. This is a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Topick in the winter; for though warm water warm the part during the time of Fomentation; yet after Fomentation it leaves the part cold, becauſe it drew out the heat to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: wherefore Oyl is excellent, for it ſtops the Pores, and keeps in the heat. Theſe two Medicaments are to be applyed to the ulcerate part by ſtupes, ſponges, or pledgets.</p>
                     <p>One thing you are to look to, and to provide before fomentation, that the Body of the party, unto which they are to be applyed, be neither plethorick (for then too much moiſture may he attracted) nor cacochymical (for then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humors may be drawn) both which will hinder the cure of the Ulcer. Uſe therefore firſt of all Phlebotomy, or Purgation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But you may not without cauſe ask, when Fomentation is to be left?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that two things ſhall declare unto you the period of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting: the Firſt is the ſubſtance of the part, the Second is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: wherefore when you ſee the part a little tumefied, ſoft and moiſt, and of a ruddy colour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt from Fomentation; otherwiſe the Humor attracted will be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>If a moiſt diſtemperature hath poſſeſſed the part, then the fleſh of the part will be moiſt; ſpongy fleſh will be apt to grow, and plenty of excrements will flow from the Ulcer: In this caſe ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccatives, or Sarcoticks mingled with <hi>Baſiticum aureum,</hi> or <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his <hi>Liniment</hi> are to be uſed: with an Ounce of any of theſe Unguents you may uſe one dram and a half of theſe Deſiccatives: ſuch are the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, Lead cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd, <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> Bones and Horns calcin'd, the powder of the root of <hi>Iris,</hi> Maſtick, <hi>Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and ſuch like. <hi>Aes uſtum,</hi> the Pumice-ſtone calcined, and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus rubeus</hi> are excellent. If the part be diſtempered with heat, then the part ulcerate will be ſomewhat tumeſied, hard and red; and beſides the relation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed party, your own feeling will aſſure you. In this caſe uſe <hi>Aqua caleis vivae,</hi> ſo called; but more properly <hi>Lixivium calcis vivae,</hi> wherein ſome litharge of Silver hath been boiled: you may uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Snow-water, wherein ſome of your <hi>Vitriolum album</hi> or white Copperas hath been diſſolved: In a quart of <hi>Epſome</hi> water, diſſolve
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52816:63"/>two drams of Roman Vitriol, you ſhall have a water of the colour of a light Emerauld fit for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In a pint of Plantain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſſolve two drams of ordinary Vitriol or Alum; and this alſo is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If Cold diſtemper the part, which you ſhall diſcern by its colour, hardneſs, ſenſe of the Patient, and your own feeling, then apply to the ulcerate part <hi>Baſilicum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> my <hi>Baſilicum, Arcaeus</hi> his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>The Third thing which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to make up a compound Ulcer, was a ſymptome annexed to an Ulcer. Now of all other, Pain it the chiefeſt: for Firſt, pain by attraction brings much moiſture to the part, and ſo hinders the Cure. Secondly it inflames the parts. Thirdly, it cauſes watching, Fainting, and oftentimes Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Pain is removed two manner of ways. Firſt, by taking away the cauſe of pain, which is affluxion of Humors: How this is to be done we have ſpoken already. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by application of Anodyne Medicaments. Theſe ought to be temperately hot, and ſubtil.

                        <p>Of the differences of the milder ſort of compound <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, and firſt of a ſinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>leer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any calloſity.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving diſcourſed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter of thoſe things which make the milder fort of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to be accounted compound; to wit, a ſickneſs, cauſe or ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome complicate with an Ulcer; In this Chapter I will ſet down the differences of milder Ulcers, and the cure of them. Theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are taken either from the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or Adjuncts. From the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure theſe. Of the milder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Ulcers ſome are plain, ſome ſinuous. I call that a plain Ulcer, wherein the Skin is eroded, and the ſubjacent fleſh, and the whole Ulcer is preſented to the ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare and uncovered. No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Ulcer is to be accompted of an eaſie cure: becauſe both skill and experience are required in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this.</p>
                     <p>And thô theſe plain Ulcers be fubject wholly to the ſight, yet let no Man imagine that all of them are of equal facility to be cured; for according to the nature of Grief, the quality of the cauſe, and the invaſion of the ſymptomes, the Ulcers with which theſe things are complicate, are either of more eaſie or difficult cure. A plain compound Ulcer has three ſcopes in the cure of it; for Firſt, that muſt be removed which makes it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, whether it be a diſeaſe, cauſe, or ſymptome: Secondly, That which is by eroſion loſt, muſt be repaired; and Thirdly, The part muſt be cicatrized: How all theſe three indications are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have ſet down at large in the former Chapter, ſo that I need not to repeat any thing.</p>
                     <p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52816:64"/>according to Nature were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>There be two cauſes of theſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Ulcers, to wit, Apoſtemes lying deep a long time, or not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened, although they be not ſo deep, and wounds not well cured: for Quittour lurking a long time, either in a Tumor ſuppurate, or in a deep wound not well cleanſed, muſt needs corrupt and get a ſharp quality, which makes to it ſelf theſe cavities, which are not ſo eaſily fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Fleſh and united: for unto the part affected, now weakened, excrementitious Humors ſlow, not only from the parts adjacent, but from the whole Body alſo, which make the Ulcer hard to be cured. Theſe Burrows are found out by Probes of Silver, or Lead, and wax-Candles: If there be more Orifices than one, by Injections. They ſometimes are ſuperficial, ſometimes deep; ſometimes ſtreight, ſometimes oblique; ſometimes there is but one cavern, ſometimes there be more.</p>

                        </gap>hen I will ſhew you how cavernous Ulcers are to be cured, and then how <hi>Fiſtula's.</hi> There are two ways of curing of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous Ulcer: the Firſt is by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Medicaments: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is by opening and dreſſing, according to Art. If you go about to cure ſuch an Ulcer by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without opening, then two ſcopes offer themſelves; to wit, the filling of the Cavity with Fleſh, and the agglutination of the parts disjoyned. The incarnatives muſt be drying without eroſion, and the glutinatives muſt have aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides deſiccation. Both theſe intentions you may perform with the Injection of this Medicament following, ℞ <hi>Aq. decoct. hord.</hi>

Thirdly, in the Orifice put in a leaden Tent, or Pipe: but ſhort, hollow, wider in the upper than lower part, and having the brims of the upper part turned. That it may be kept from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52816:65"/>ſlipping in, ſhut the Orifice and the upper part of the Tent or Pipe with an Emplaſter; let it be one of thoſe named before: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter muſt be ſnipt, that it may give way to the Quittour which flows out of the Cavity: above the Emplaſter apply a piece of a Sponge, which muſt be ſoft, moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Medicament with which you dreſs the Ulcer, and wrung out: for the Sponge ſucks into it ſelf the Quittour, keeps the brims of the Orifice dry, and preſerves them from excoriation: above the Sponge lay a pledget of Tow: the lower Cavity, or from the bottom of the Ulcer to the Orifice, muſt be boulſtered. Above all lay a double ſoft linnen Cloth. Begin your rowling at the bottom, where it muſt be ſomewhat ſtrait, to bring the ſides of the Ulcer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both to expreſs the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and to procure agglutination, but let it cauſe no pain; for it would diſtemper the part: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orifice the rowling muſt be ſomewhat ſlack, that the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour may have way to iſſue out. Every third day (if much water flow not) dreſs it, looſe firſt the Rowler, the turnings whereof are about the Orifice, take away the Sponge and Emplaſter; Firſt, that you may come to cleanſe the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; Secondly, that you may make trial whether Nature goes about to agglutinate the parts: which you ſhall diſcern, if the excrementitious Matter abate, be laudable in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and conſiſtence, and have no ill ſmell, and if the Cavity be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, and without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tumor. On the contrary, if the Quittour be plentiful, ill-coloured and ſtinking, if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity be painful, and a conſpicuous Tumor appear, you may perſwade your ſelves that no unition is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. Dreſs the Ulcer according to this manner, until perfect ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination be cauſed, which yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhall know by the ſigns afore ſaid going before; if no Quittour or very little appear in the Orifice, ï the Cavity be equal without Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and no pain be felt: when you perceive theſe ſigns, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs your ſelves for the cicatrizing of the Ulcer. If after a dreſſing or two, thin gleeting Matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, yet deſpair not; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch Matter is wrung out of the parts by reaſon of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament drying; the nature of the part, as being nervous, membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or glandulous; or Laſtly, by compreſſing of the Ulcer by bolſtering and rowling. As for the Emplaſter applied to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity it ſelf, it is to be renewed, when it is defiled with Quittour, or leaves cleaving. Dreſs the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer as ſeldom as you can, contrary to Empiricks; for often dreſſing gives way to cold Air, which is hurtful to Ulcers, and hinders uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus you may proceed in curing of cavernous Ulcers, if the excrementitious Matter have way to flow from them freely; which will be, if the Orifice be in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part, or lateral, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or <hi>Sinus</hi> being lateral alſo; for then, ſuch a poſture may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as will further evacuation of the Matter. But if by reaſon of other Figures of the Cavity, the Cavity cannot diſcharge it ſelf of the filth of the Ulcer, then until this impediment be removed, no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52816:65"/>expurgation, incarnation, or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination can be expected: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore way is to be made by inciſion or a cauſtick.</p>
                     <p>This you muſt do: Firſt, if the Cavity be lower than the Orifice either directly, or obliquely, but not very deep: Secondly, if it go very deep alſo, as in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, and ſuch Ulcers, penetrating in the Breaſt, where the Cavity moſt commonly is lower than the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Thirdly, if the hollowneſs be very broad. In theſe caſes way muſt be made by theſe means for the Matter, that it may be expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: otherwiſe, if it be kept in, it will erode the parts adjacent, and no incarnation or conſolidation can be looked for. We may make way for the Quittour two manner of ways: Firſt, by opening the lower end of the <hi>Sinus</hi> only; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by opening the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
                     <p>The firſt courſe we are to take, if the <hi>Sinus</hi> be of an enormous bigneſs, or if it be in a great joynt; for great wounds in ſuch Joynts are mortal, according to <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> or if there be great Veſſels, Nerves or Tendons of Muſcles in the way; which are like to bring fearful fluxes of Blood, or lameneſs: which things skill in Anatomy will teach you. If none of theſe caſes hinder you, then it is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way to lay open the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which is the ſecond way. Theſe two ſcopes we may attain unto by two means; to wit, by a Cauſtick and Inciſion.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſtick we are to uſe: Firſt, if the party be timorous, and will not admit Section: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the Cavity be in a part, wherein a great ſear may cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity: Thirdly, if there be fear of a great flux of Blood: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the diſeaſed Party be ſick and weak.</p>
                     <p>If a Cauſtick be to be applyed, if the ſituation of the part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Sinus is,</hi> be in the upper ſide, then apply your <hi>Lapis internalis:</hi> for it corrodes ſooneſt, deepeſt, with leſs pain, and will not be ſo apt by running and ſpreading to burn the parts adjacent, or to cauſe a greater ſolution of unity than we intended. But if the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> be in the lower ſide, as in the ſole of the Foot, or in a part very depending; then I adviſe you to uſe a Cauſtick made of ſtrong Sope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>ub the part with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and when the part is mortified then to open it: Firſt, this is not to be done, but when the Skin is very thin; beſides this, this rubbing cauſes far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pain than the application of it to the part, being defended. Be ever of this mind in your practice, to uſe the mildeſt means; the fruits which you reap by ſo doing will be Reſpect, Love, Credit, and Gain. When you have perceived that the force of your corroſive Medicament has mortified all to the very Cavity, then procure the fall of the Eſchar, with the application either of <hi>Dialthaea ſimplex,</hi> or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without Salt. There is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance comparable to this for this purpoſe, When the Eſchar is gone, then proceed in curing of the Ulcer, as hath been ſaid, by mundificative incarnative, and cicatrizing Medicaments.</p>

                        </gap>, from the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude which it hath with the long and hollow windy inſtruments of Muſicians: in <hi>Latine</hi> it is called <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and ſo in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue for this ſame cauſe,</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fiſtula</hi> then is <hi>a ſinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, narrow and long with calloſity.</hi> Here you are to obſerve, that a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> beſides ſinuoſity, muſt have callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and narrowneſs. It happens moſt commonly, when Apoſtemes have been opened, that the inner <hi>Superficies</hi> of the parts, kept aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a ſharp Humor, become in progreſs of time callous. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which cauſes this calloſity, muſt be more aſtringent than ſharp; for it rather tanus the part by reaſon of its acerbity, than erodes it by reaſon of its acrimony? beſides this, <hi>Fiſtulas</hi> are for the moſt part indolent, unleſs they end in parts very ſenſible, as Nerves, Tendons, Membranes, and Joynts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chymiſts will have this Humor to be the Saltpeter of the little World, or Man, ſeparate from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52816:67"/>the natural Salt of the Balſam, or radical moiſture of the Body. That this Salt is cooling and anodyne, Practicers of Phyſick do bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for in burning Fevers it is added to Juleps, which are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for cooling, and aſſwaging of pain, under the name of <hi>Sal prunellae:</hi> It doth alſo, by reaſon of its ſtyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity unite the Spirits, and ſtay the immoderate Exhalation of them.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are taken either from the Eſſence of a <hi>Fistula,</hi> or from the Accidents. Calloſity then with a <hi>Fistula,</hi> or Whiſtle-like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is the Pathognomonical Sign of a <hi>Fistula.</hi> The Signs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Accidents are two ſold: for they are taken either from the Quittour, or the manner of pain. In a <hi>Fistula</hi> the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is ever virulent, ugly and ſtinking: as for the manner of pain, it is but ſmall; unleſs it be by reaſon of the ſenſibleneſs of the parts named by me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>As for the differences, or divers kinds of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, I will only ſet down thoſe which further either the Cure, or Prediction. Let this then be the firſt difference: <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go ſhallowly along under the Skin; or they paſs deeper to the ſubjacent parts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s end either in the Fleſhy parts, or they paſs to the Bones, or to the Cavities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thirdly, ſome are ſtreight, ſome crooked. Fourthly, ſome are ſingle, ſome manifold; yet proceeding from ſome one Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Theſe are the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, or profitable differences of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>Now it follows, that I ſpeak of the Signs of theſe Differences. 1. Whether there be more callous Sinuoſities than one, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by the quantity of the Quittour; for if more copious Quittour flow from a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> than can be expected from one <hi>Sinus,</hi> it not paſſing to any remarkable Cavity, it is likely that there are more than one. The changing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the poſition of the Body, and compreſſion of the part will ſhew this; for the flowing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ceaſed, if after the changing of the poſition of the whole Body, or one Member, it run out again, it is probable that there are more Sinuoſities. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if variety of Quittour flow, it is an Argument that ſundry parts are affected, and more Sinuoſities like to be. But to what parts the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> paſſes, receive theſe Signs: If it paſs to the fleſhy parts, the Quittour appears white, ſmooth and plentiful; beſides this, thy part whereon the end of the Probe ſtays, ſeems ſoft. If it paſs to a Nerve, a fatty and oleous Matter iſſues out, the motion which is cauſed be that Sinew is impaired, and the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is more painful than others are; beſides, the Probe touching the Sinew, cauſeth a pricking pain with a certain numneſs. If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> paſs to the Veins and Arteries, yet ſo that the Coats of them be not eroded, then the Matter which it yieldeth is like unto the Lees of Claret wine; for Blood, ſweating thorow the coats or poroſities of the Veſſels, mingled with the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, cauſes ſuch a ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>If the Coat of a Vein he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded, Blood iſſues thick, of a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52816:67"/>dark Colour, and without quaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaping; but if the Tunicles of an Artery be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then the Blood is redder of a more bright colour, and comes forth with ejaculation.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> reach to the Bone, that which the end of the Probe toucheth appears hard, and yields not to the Probe, neither is any pain felt. If the Probe being preſſed ſlip, no Carioſity has ſeized upon the Bone; for a ſound Bone is ſmooth and ſlippery: If the Probe ſtay upon it, appearing ſmooth, it is diſpoſed to Carioſity; but if the Bone appear unequal and rough, then it is undoubtedly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Beſides this, the Quittour which flows from a corrupt Bone is thin, yellow, and ill ſmelling. So much then concerning the Signs, which ſhews us the divers kinds of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>Now let me give ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preſages or Predictions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curing of them, that Men may become circumſpect in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Cure of ſuch as ſhall be preſented to them. Let this then be the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is of eaſie Cure. Firſt, by reaſon of the unaptneſs of the part to admit convenient application of Medicaments: for unleſs they reach to the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> which is not ſo eaſie a matter (as you ſhall find by practice) no good can be done. Secondly, by reaſon of the quality of the Medicaments, which are able to remove the Calloſity; for theſe muſt be ſharp and biting, and ſo cauſe pain: from whence come ſymptomatical Fevers, and fainting very often, eſpecially in tender and young Bodies. And thirdly, by reaſon of the Humor, which cauſes a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> which yields not to ordinary and vulgar Medicaments. Let this be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s which are ſhallow, paſſing no deeper than the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Carnoſ,</hi> or at the furtheſt than the Membrane of the Muſcles or Muſcle ſubjacent, are more eaſily cured than thoſe which pierce deeper; for thoſe by Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may eaſily be cured, but theſe not ſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3, The third ſhall be this: <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi>'s wreathed, or with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Sinuoſities, require inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Medicaments may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to all the parts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth, if a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> not paſſing further than the fleſhy parts, be not of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that in a young and a ſtrong Body, it affords good hope of curing: Imagine the contrary event, if contrary circumſtances be accompanied.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Receive this as the fifth. If the extremity of a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> end in the Tunicles of the Veins or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, or both, (the Signs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have delivered, when I ſpake of the differences of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s) then you are to meet with the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Haemorrhage, the Coats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eroded; for if you labour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlarge the Orifice, or to take away the Calloſity by ſharp Medicaments, the Flux will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. This accident happens moſt commonly in <hi>Bubo</hi>'s of the Groyn, not ſpeedily cured, and <hi>Parotides</hi> under the Ear, and Phlegmons in the Arm-pits: Theſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52816:68"/>parts being Emunctorious, and near to the divarication of the great Veſſels, to wit, the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta,</hi> deſcending and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s ending in very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts, as Nerves, Tendons, the Bladder, the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and the like, are carefully and mildly to be handled, by reaſon of the Symptoms which often enſue, as accidental Fevers, Lipothymies, loſs of Appetite and Sleep: all which are apt to bring an extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the whole Body, and ſo to defraud the part of more than requiſite nouriſhment, without which Conſolidation cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in remarkable cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the Throat, Breſt, Belly, are hard to be cured, becauſe the end is more dependent than the Orifice, which exceedingly hinders Conſolidation.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the back the <hi>Spina</hi> be carious, ſhun the Cure, for theſe at length bring an extenuation of the Body, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits not being in requiſite plenty communicated to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fistula</hi>'s in the Joynts are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; for if great Wounds of the Joynts, even in Bodies of a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, be pronounced by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to be mortal: what ſhall we deem of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in theſe parts, where beſides the enormous dilations, that muſt be procured in Cure, there is of neceſſity an ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Body?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſeeing the Joynts are framed of parts very ſenſible, as Tendons, Nerves, Membranes and Ligaments, exceeding great pain muſt be cauſed by the application of Corroſive Medicaments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> cannot be cured, and ſo the party muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly be troubled and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thirdly, ſeeing the Joynts are ſeated in depending parts, and are not fleſhy (and ſo, as they are apt to receive Humors attracted by pain, they are leſs able to diſcuſs the Humors received, partly by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Membranes, partly by reaſon of the weakneſs of Natural Heat) who may not eaſily perceive the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of curing of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in theſe parts?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s having ſundry Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuoſities are more hardly cured than thoſe which have but one; both becauſe the labour is the greater, and Medicaments cannot ſo conveniently be applied.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s which have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time, ſeated in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part, remote from any principal, by which Nature hath been accuſtomed to diſcharge ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the whole Body, and not painful, but rather ſlovingly or ſluttiſh, are rather to be kept open than cured; for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the health of the Body, and hinder the aſſault of other Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>I know a Gentleman who had a <hi>Fiſtula in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> about twenty years, yet unknown to his Wife, who lived notwithſtanding very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> period of his life: having ſent for me a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he acquainted me with it. Having taken a view of it, and perceiving that it was dry, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> colour; I pronounced
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52816:68"/>his end to be at hand, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordly fell out.</p>
                     <p>Now it is time to haſten to the ſetting down of the Cure of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in general. In the ſixth Section of the Treatiſe aſcribed to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> there is one of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s: In it he ſpeaks ſomewhat particularly of a <hi>Fiſtula in ano,</hi> and of the curing of it by Ligation. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is delivered in that Treatiſe, ſeems to be an exſcription of notes out of his <hi>Adverſaria</hi> or Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, rather than a deliberate or methodical Diſcourſe of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Howſoever, it is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced rather as a Pledge and Sign of his willing mind to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Poſterity, than a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to enrich the Knowledge, and further the Practice of any one who ſhall go about to cure any mean <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> Peruſe the Treatiſe, and you ſhall find me to ſpeak a Truth, if you ſhew your ſelves impartial Cenſurers. Seeing I have delivered unto you in the preſages of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, that ſometimes it is moſt expedient to leave ſome <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi>'s uncured, I muſt make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a twofold manner of curing them: The one ſhall be called <hi>palliative</hi> or cloaked; the other <hi>true</hi> and real.</p>
                     <p>The firſt affords ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eaſe to the Patient; but the ſecond procures perfect health. A palliative Cure, I would have you to underſtand, to be when a Sinuoſity is inwardly dried for a time, and the Orifice ſeems to be ſhut up by a thin Skin, until freſh and new Humidity bedew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sinuoſity, and open the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice again. This kind of Cure is moſt ſit to be uſed towards thoſe in whoſe Bodies a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> ſupplies the place of a Fontanel, to diſcharge ſuperfluous Humors, which Nature turns out from the principal parts, for the preſervation of the health of the Body.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know this manner of Cure ought to be uſed, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty immediately before the opening of the Orifice find ſome diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and afterward, the Orifice being opened, eaſe. To compaſs this manner of Cure, three inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are required.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a convenient Diet muſt be obſerved: This is performed by feeding upon ſuch meats as are of eaſie concoction, and afford good Juice, and in ſuch meaſure as <hi>Leonardus Leſſius</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> preſcribes; and <hi>Lodovicus, Cornarus</hi> obſerved from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his decrepit Age. They adviſe moderation both in Meat and Drink. Patients now a days would think themſelves hardly dealt with, if they ſhould be ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day to eat no more Bread and Meat than a pound, and to drink no more Drink than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces. It is an eaſier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſatisfie Nature, than the Appetite.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Body is to be purged, not by an Eradicative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, wherein Scammonie, Ellebore, or Colocynth enters; but a purging Diet, or a purging Ale; I will deliver unto you a Pattern of both. Let your purging Drink be thus Diſpenſed: ℞ <hi>Sarſ.</hi> ℥ iij. <hi>Rad.

So you have the palliative Cure of a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the true Cure of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in general.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw I will ſet down the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Curing truly and really <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in general, and the practice of the ſame in curing of ſome <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in ſome ſpecial places of the Body, which require ſome extraordinary conſiderations. Such are <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the the great corners of the eyes, <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the Breaſt, <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s <hi>in ano,</hi> and <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the Joynts.</p>
                     <p>The means to attain to this manner of Cure are threefold Diae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetical, Pharmaceutical, and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diaetetical, I have ſet it down amongſt other things which are required in the Cure of an Ulcer in general. It ſhall be ſufficient to inſinuate now only, that the Diet of thoſe who are troubled with <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s muſt be very ſparing, and of Meats and Drinks which afford a laudable Juice, and are of eaſie concoction, that Crudities and ſharp Humors flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the affected part, hinder not the Cure. And undoubtedly too liberal Diet, unto which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of theſe parts are too much accuſtomed, is the cauſe of the Recidivation of theſe, and other Griefs.</p>
                     <p>As for the Pharmaceutical means, they are of two ſorts, to wit, Purgative and Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dative.</p>
                     <p>If the Body of the diſeaſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be Cacochymical, with ſome <hi>Plethora,</hi> miniſter the purging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, or Ale, for the ſpace of a Week, deſcribed by me in the former Chapter.

                     <p>The Chirurgical means afford unto us five intentions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all then, the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is to be dilated; for ſeldom doth it fall out otherwiſe, that this Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not requiſite, unleſs it be in a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in the Cheek, which was cauſed and maintained by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Tooth, which being drawn, the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> will heal of it ſelf, a conſolidative Emplaſter being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to keep out the Air.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fiſtula</hi> may be dilated three manner of ways, by Inciſion, by putting in Tents framed of ſuch things, as ſwell, after they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed the humidity of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula;</hi> and laſt of all by the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> tent.</p>
                     <p>As for Inciſion, it is to be uſed in ſtrong Bodies, if the <hi>Fistula</hi> be not deep, and only runs along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Skin, no deeper than the Membrane of a Muſcle, if it be in a fleſhy part. Secondly, if the <hi>Fistula</hi> have many Sinuoſities before the Inciſion is made, the <hi>Fistula</hi> is to be dilated by ſome of the other means, which I will deliver
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52816:70"/>preſently: Secondly, the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which remove Calloſity (whereof anon) muſt be applied; both theſe Intentions muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before Inciſion; otherwiſe you ſhall hardly know how far your Inciſion is to be extended, and ſhall leave ſome part of the <hi>Callus</hi> ſtill, which will make way for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidivation and Relapſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way to dilate a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,</hi> is to uſe inſtead of Tents ſuch things as ſwell, whereof there be ſundry, as Gentian root, the pith of the Elder; or Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; but the Sponge twiſted with Thread, after that it is wrung hard and wreathed, far exceeds all theſe: for it both imbibes more moiſture, and dilates much more. I will acquaint you with a preparation of the Sponge, which is excellent: and this is it: Melt a rowl of your ſimple Melilot Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter; when it is very hot, let a thick Sponge imbibe it. This Sponge having ſo drawn unto it ſelf the Emplaſter, put between two Trenchers, which Trenchers with the Sponge put into a ſtrong Preſs, and preſs them hard. After an hour or two, when you think the Sponge to be cold, unſcrue the Preſs and take out the Trenchers with the Sponge, you ſhall find the Sponge become a firm ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, reſembling Green Cheeſe. Of this ſubſtance you may cut out Tents of what faſhion you will: This will not only exceedingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> by ſucking unto it the Humidity; but will alſo digeſt the Calloſity.</p>
                     <p>The third way of dilating a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,</hi> I ſet down to be by the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi>-Tent. It is this way to be made; Make good ſtore of ſine Lint, from which draw away all the Threads, that nothing remain but the Fluet, or the ſoft Down of it; of this ſoft Down, with the white of an Egg beaten, make your Tents of what thickneſs or length the Sinuoſity of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, by adding ſtill ſome of the Down: Do this upon a piece of Deal-board ſmooth and eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>. If you ſtill enlarge the quantity of the Tents, you may dilate the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> as much as you will; for theſe Tents being dried, will pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Cavity, as a Probe, without bending (if they be well made) by reaſon of their ſtifneſs. Of this manner of Tent there is great uſe, in taking away the Calloſities of of ſome <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, and in healing of them, beſides this uſe, as you ſhall hear anon.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Chirurgical inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to remove the <hi>Callus:</hi> this is bred by reaſon of the influxion of an Humor, not of an uniform ſubſtance: for beſides the thin parts, which are diſcuſſed or dried by both the natural and extraneous Heat, it muſt have a thick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to cauſe this <hi>Callus,</hi> it being indurated: this muſt be either Phlegm, if the <hi>Callus</hi> be white; or Melancholy, if it be livid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dogmatical Phyſicians; the Chymiſts appoint it to be Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, as I have ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning this Calloſity is bred rather in the external Orifice, than in the inner Sinuoſity: For firſt, the Skin, which is thick of it ſelf, ſooner grows hard than the Fleſh which is ſoft; Secondly, becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtill labours to thruſt out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements to the Skin. In progreſs of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52816:71"/>time <hi>Fistula</hi>'s having become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verate, the whole paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts Calloſity.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know by this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the paſſage be fiſtulated or no: If by the intruſion of the Probe great pain is ſelt, and Blood iſſues out, the <hi>Callus</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; but if no Blood follow, and little pain is ſelt, be ſure then that it is confirmed.</p>
                     <p>The Calloſity is removed either by Medicaments, or an actual Cautery. The Medicaments are of three degrees: for ſome are more mild, and theſe are of an emolliting and digeſting quality, firſt if the Calloſity be but ſmall in a fleſhy part and young body: ſuch are <hi>Dialthaea cum gummi,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de poeto.</hi> Every ounce of either of them having a dram of <hi>Turbith</hi> mineral, or Precipitate mingled with Alume with it, is effectual.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſome are more harſh, for they muſt mundifie ſtrongly, if the <hi>Callus</hi> be ſomewhat hard, and the party ſomewhat aged; ſuch are <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Apoſtolorum, Avicen.</hi> having Precipitate and Alume or <hi>Turbith</hi> with Alume mingled with it. <hi>Egyptiacum</hi> is ſtronger than this, but I ſhould rather uſe <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Apoſtolorum</hi> than it, adding more of the aforenamed Cathaeretical Powder to it; for it cauſes greater pain, and procures not ſo good Quittour as the <hi>Apostolorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, the Medicaments which are to remove an inveterate <hi>Callus,</hi> are Cauſtick; and even of theſe ſome are more gentle, ſome exceedingly fierce. The more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are theſe. I. ℞ <hi>Auripigmenti Sulphur. vivi, &amp; Calcis vivae an.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>ſiat Pulvis ſubtilis.</hi> II.

Mineralis non leti, Vitrioli vomitivi, &amp; Boli orient. optimi, an. partes aequales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſtrongeſt of all I will deliver unto you two magiſtral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions only, far ſurpaſſing all others. I. Is <hi>M. Hale</hi> his Powder, who was famous in his time for curing of <hi>Fistula</hi>'s: this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it: ℞ <hi>Aquil. mineral. Vitrioli vomitivi, &amp; Terrae rubr. oriental. an. part. aequales.</hi> II. Is this, which I uſe in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s and <hi>Struma</hi>'s: ℞ <hi>Realgar. albi, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigment. &amp; Calcis vivae, an. part. aequales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may enquire how theſe are to be uſed; If you have dilated the <hi>Fistula</hi> by Inciſion, beſprinkle the <hi>Callus</hi> with ſome of the Powders; but if you have done it by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way ſet down by me, then uſe the Powders mingled with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Populeon,</hi> wherewith ann your <hi>Fistula</hi> Tent, or apply a Trochisk made of theſe Powders and <hi>Populeon,</hi> and afterwards dryed.</p>
                     <p>After the application either of the <hi>Fistula</hi> Tent armed with the Unguent, or of the Trochisk, two things you are to obſerve: I. That you apply an Anodyne Cataplaſm; the fellow to this which I ſhall now deliver unto you, ſhall not be found. It is alſo matchleſs in raging pains of the Gout: ℞ <hi>Lact. Vaccin.</hi>

If there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sinuoſities, yet do not pierce to any remarkable Cavity, as of the Breſt and Belly, then you are to diſſolve theſe Powders in ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as in <hi>Aqua calcis,</hi> Plantain water, Metheglin, a gentle Lee; Alume water, or Vitriol wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                     <p>The ſecond way to remove a <hi>Callus</hi> by an actual Cautery is an Invention of <hi>Ab aqua pendente:</hi> He will have an Inſtrument like to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Third Chirurgical Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, to mundiſie the part: this medicament will perform it: ℞ <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni albi</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. <hi>

                     <p>Then you are to addreſs your ſelves to the fourth Intention Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical, which is to unite and conſolidate the parts disjoyned. To accompliſh this: firſt draw by an Alembick the Spirit of theſe Herbs following, putting ſo much Spring-water, as will be three inches above the Simples, to them; The Roots of <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda,</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil, Biſtort, Comfrey, the leſſer Centaury, <hi>Virga aurea,</hi> Burnet, Plantain, Knot-graſs, Yarrow, and <hi>Solomons</hi> Seal. Reſerve the Spirit by it ſelf: take the decoction remaining in the Pot from the Herbs by ſtraining; for every quart of this Decoction take half a <abbr>lb</abbr> of Hony, and ſo much Sugar: This mixture being clarified with the whites of Eggs, and ſtrained again, let it be boiled by a ſoft Fire to the conſiſtence of a Syrup. Take two ounces of the Spirit, and one ounce of the Syrup; which mingle and inject into the Sinuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and deal with it as I preſcribed, when I delivered the manner of dreſſing a ſinuous Ulcer. If any man deliver a more probable way than this, to conſolidate a <hi>Fistuld</hi> after the extirpation of the <hi>Callus,</hi> I ſhall willingly lend him mine Ears.</p>
                     <p>The laſt intention Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is to skin the Orifice, which requires no new directions. You
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52816:72"/>ſhall know the <hi>Fistula</hi> to be near whole, when the Humor which flows is little, thick, concocted, and the place void of pain and tumor: If it be altogether dry, you may pronounce the Orifice to be skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the <hi>Fistula</hi> perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>From the Premiſes you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that four things hinder the Cure of a <hi>Fistula.</hi> I. Is the Afflux of a vitious Humor. II.

The place then wherein this kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is ſeated, is the inner corner of the Eye: although it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin firſt at the holes of the upper and lower Eye-lid, from whence the Tears flow.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns are manifeſt to the Senſes: for Firſt, the Orifice offers it ſelf to view: Secondly, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the Quittour iſſues out: Thirdly, a ſmall Probe may be thruſt within the Cavity to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of the <hi>Sinus.</hi>

                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks: Firſt then, all theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s are hard to cure; for the moiſtneſs of the place hinders deſiccation, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the cure of Ulcers, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the part, (while one is awake) is in continual motion, Thirdly, by reaſon of the niceneſs of the part, choice of Medicaments muſt be had. II. If the Quittour hath made way for it ſelf to the inner paſſage of the Noſe, by that hole which paſſeth thorow the Bone of the Noſe from the corner, then we are only to procure the ſhutting up of the upper Orifice, and not to go about the ſcaling of the Bone by a fruitleſs labour, which will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding coſt the Patient great pain and grief. III. If a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in this place become cancerous, which you ſhall conjecture by the hard and livid brims, a ſtinging pain, and ſtinking virulent Matter, you are only to uſe a palliative cure, applying thoſe Medicaments which are fit for a cancerous Ulcer, whereof in the cure of a Cancer I will ſpeak at large. IV. If this continue long, it cauſes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Eye, called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Now to come to the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s; ſome are malign, the ſigns whereof I have delivered in the Prognoſticks. Some are not malign. Of theſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no malignity, ſome are without carioſity of the Bone, and ſome with carioſity of the Bone. You ſhall know that there is no carioſity of the Bone. 1. If the Apoſtem was not long continuing before it brake; for it the Tumor was firſt an <hi>Oedema Scirrhodes,</hi> and continued a long time ſo before it brake, then it is likely that the Humor corrupted the Bone before it brake. 2. If the Probe reſt not upon a part hard and rugged 3. If after dilatation of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> the carioſity be not preſented to the ſight. If circumſtances contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theſe be offered, you may conjecture that there is a carioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Bone.</p>
                     <p>To haſten to the cure of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s: If a <hi>Fiſtula lcebry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis,</hi> without corruption of the Bone, be offered to you to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, proceed after this manner: Firſt of all you are to dilate it: Secondly, you are to remove the calloſity: Thirdly, you are to mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie it: Fourthly, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate it: And laſtly, to cicatrize it.</p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52816:73"/>
                     <p>You ſhall dilate it by the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> Tent framed (as I taught in the former Chapter, according to the proportion of the ſinuoſity in the beginning: then you ſhall enlarge it more by Sponges prepared with Melilot Emplaſter, which I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſet down there. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dreſſing will diſcover all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the ſinuoſity. The <hi>Fiſtula</hi> having been thus dilated, you are to go about the removing of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> Now in performing this, there is not ſo great liberty granted, as is in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of other parts. For Firſt, ſtuid and running means ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a remarkable acrimony are not ſafe: for paſſing unto the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> they are able to erode it; from whence an Ulcer may enſue, and ſo the grief be doubled. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, even means ſolid carefully muſt be applyed, that they go no further than the ſinuoſity of the <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> It is not unknown unto you, what horrible ſymptomes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes afflict the Eye, by reaſon of a familiar Humor only exalted in degrees of acrimony: What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief then is to be expected, if heterogeneal Bodies, endued with extraordinary ſharpneſs, as theſe muſt be which remove a <hi>Callus,</hi> do ſeiſe upon the Membranes of the Eye, adjacent unto the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>Some there are who cure theſe lacrymal <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s with liquid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, as with the water of Elder, or Wall-wort flowers, in every pint of theſe diſſolving two drams of Mercury ſublimate, or more, according to the hardneſs of the calloſity. The proportion of mixture you muſt conjecture by the continuance of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> by the age of the party, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Body. If therefore a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be offered to be cured in a body young, of a ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of a tender conſtitution, then the water is to be mild; if contrary conditions do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then you are to make it more ſtrong according to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you take two parts of Plantain water, and one part of the Spirit of Niter, you ſhall have an excellent Topick according to the Principles of the Chymiſts.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be obſerved, that theſe liquid Medicaments be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly applyed to the ſinuoſity, that no part of them touch the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; to avoid the accidents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake before.</p>
                     <p>As for mine own part, I more commend the ſolid Medicaments than theſe ſtuid: for Firſt, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is more durable: Secondly, they are more ſecure, becauſe they are not ſo apt to ſpread: If the Body be young and tender, this Medicament will ſerve.

                     <p>The <hi>Callus</hi> being thus removed, you muſt mundifie it: To this

                     <p>As for the skinning: <hi>Diapalma cum ſuccis, de minio,</hi> or <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirum rubrum aſtringens</hi> will ſerve.</p>
                     <p>If in an <hi>Aegilops</hi> or lachrymal <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> the bone of the Noſe be corrupted by the Humour ſtaying in the emboſement, then two ways of curing are offered unto you.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is by actual cautery, the Second is by inciſion. Peruſe all who have written of the curing of this kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, and you ſhall find that all with one accord ſubſcribe to the actual cautery.</p>
                     <p>The actual cautery muſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Figure the ſtone of an Olive: The parts adjacent muſt be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the fire, either by an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Plate according to <hi>Parey,</hi> or a Cane according to <hi>Ab aqua pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente;</hi> you may make choice of which you will: you muſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impreſs it, to dry the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and the ſooner to procure the ſcaling of the Bone. And although Authors, after the application of the actual cautery, preſcribe fatty things to haſten the ſeparation of the eſchar, yet I adviſe you not to uſe them; for the part is moiſt of it ſelf, and ſo the application of ſuch Medicaments would procure a ſordid Ulcer: Apply therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pledgets or Tents dipped in Red Wine, and above all <hi>Diapalma</hi> or <hi>Emplaſtrum de minio,</hi> or <hi>de Smeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> When the Bone hath caſt a ſcale, then conſolidate and skin it, as I have ſet down before.</p>
                     <p>It is not unknown with what difficulty Patients admit the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an actual cautery, to a part much diſtant from any of the principal, and wherein there is but ſmall ſenſibility. What will a Patient troubled with this grief do, if you make mention of cauteriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made in this place, ſo near the Eye and the Brain it ſelf? If at any time you make mention of ſuch a kind of cure to a Patient, to try how he ſtands affected to this operation; let me intreat you not to urge it too much, as if the cure of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> could not otherwiſe be compaſſed, if you find the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient averſe, leſt you drive him away, and ſo you looſe both cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and gain. When in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey I practiſed Chirurgery, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times this kind of grief having been preſented unto me, I ever found the Patients ſtrucken into a terror and amazement, as ſoon as mention was made of Cauterizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherefore I ſet my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at work, to find out a way to cure a <hi>Fiſtula lachrymaliss,</hi> leſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, but more ſure and effectual, which I will not conceal from you, becauſe this grief doth often come to your hands, and both great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and gain is purchaſed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Cure.</p>
                     <p>My manner of cure is this: Firſt of all, having with a ſmall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52816:74"/>Probe bended, found out the Cavity both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, I draw a line with Ink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Glandule of the Eye, and the <hi>Trochlea</hi> or the Pulley, through which the ſmall Tendon of the firſt oblique Muſcle called <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> or <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>or,</hi> the uppermoſt and greateſt, paſſes, and ends obliquely in the uppermoſt part of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea:</hi> then I make inciſion to the Bone; the part inciſed I divide with the Nails of the fore-ſingers, until the inciſion be ſo much dilated, that it will without difficulty admit a pretty Pledget: this being done, I thruſt in a ſmall Trochisk made of Turbith mineral before it be waſhed, the vomitive Vitriol, and the beſt <hi>Terra ſigillata</hi> wrought with <hi>Populeum</hi> to the form of a ſtiff Paſte, and afterward dried. About the Trochisk I apply a Pledget armed with <hi>Populeum,</hi> which I keep to the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> by an Emplaſter of <hi>Diapalma cum ſuccis,</hi> malaxed with the Oil of Henbane. Afterward filling the orbit of the Eye with little bolſters made or ſoft Linnen-cloth folded, and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Aqua ſpermatis ranarum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurata,</hi> I rowl up the Eye. The ſame dreſſings I uſe Morning and Evening, until the Trochisk with the <hi>Callus</hi> fall out of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: which when I perceive, I diligently view the Bone, to ſee how much is carious, unto it I apply the Powder of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> if the diſeaſed party be aged, and of a firm conſtitution of Body; but if the party be young, and of a tender conſtitution, I beſprinkle the Bone with <hi>Pulvis Cephalicus.</hi> The cavity of the part inciſed I fill up with a piece of the Sponge dreſſed with Melilot Emplaſter, as I delivered in the former Chapter: about it I apply a Pledget armed with <hi>Popúleum,</hi> all which I couch down cloſe, with the Emplaſters and Bolſters kept to the Eye with a Rowler.</p>
                     <p>This manner of dreſſing I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue until the ſcale of the carious Bone caſts, which moſt commonly falls out about the Twentieth day. When the ſcale is removed, I mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſie the part with <hi>Mel roſatum,</hi> or <hi>Mel rutaceum;</hi> then I procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation by the Syrup of Myrtles, or of red Roſes dried, And laſt of all I cicatrize the part affected with ſome epulotical Emplaſter, whereof I have ſet down ſufficient ſtore heretofore, and ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when I ſhall diſcourſe of an Ulcer which hardly admits skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I have made ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this manner of curing an <hi>Aegilops</hi> in ſundry perſons. And I truely affirm, that I never miſſed of the Cure of any one with whom I thus dealt: neither ſhall you (I hope) if punctually you obſerve theſe obſervations in your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>And this Practice is confirmed by <hi>Hildanus, Obſ.</hi> 23. <hi>Cent.</hi> 5. Who cured a <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis</hi> in a Boy about Thirteen years old; he had been troubled Four years with it in his Left Eye: the Bone was not only carious, but tears, when he cryed, trickled out at the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> the Gland was ſo much eroded. This Boy was ſo impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and peeviſh, that an actual Cantery (which <hi>Hildanus</hi> accounts the beſt remedy for a lachrymal <hi>Fiſtula</hi>) could not be uſed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having ordered his Diet, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52816:74"/>purged the Patient, and made a Seton in his Neck. A few days after, when the Seton run, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his potential Cauſtick, which cauſes no pain. When the Eſchar was fallen, he dilated the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> to the Bone with an eſcharotick Unguent, and prepared Sponge. Then he ſtrewed good ſtore of powdered <hi>Euphorbium</hi> on the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,</hi> and upon it applied a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Gum Elemi;</hi> when theſe things had been uſed for ſome weeks, the Bone ſcaled; and when the Scale was extracted, half a drop of Balſam of <hi>Tolu</hi> was applied once a day to the Ulcer, which quickly healed up, and continued ſound and firm. And a little after the Seton was dried and healed up. And by the way obſerve, that <hi>Hildanus</hi> in this Cure aſcribes moſt to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may fall out that the whole ſubſtance of the Bone of the Noſe ſubjacent to the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> may be carious, being of its own nature thin, and the Head of the party beſides very rheumatick, ſo that being often cured in the opinion both of the Chirurgeon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed party, yet it breaks out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. In ſuch a caſe you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me, how you ſhall fall off from ſuch a Cure with your own credit. To this I anſwer, that there is yet a Subterfuge; and a way left to give contentment to the afflicted Patient: To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this, firſt dilate again the ſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, until the corrupt Bone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as hath been ſhewed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Secondly, pierce the bone of the Noſe with a Gimlet, that the Quittour may have recourſe to the Noſtrils, which are appointed as ſhoars to diſcharge the flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick excrements of the Brain, and to draw in freſh Air for the refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration of the Lungs: and then cure the ſuperjacent fleſhy and skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, as I taught you, when I ſet down the palliative manner to cure a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> This manner of cure being the laſt refuge, it will undoubtedly give contentment to the Patient: for the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders ſhall obſerve no deformity external in him, and he himſelf ſhall not be able to diſcern the turning of the Quittour from the Glandule outwardly, to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtril inwardly: beſides this, he himſelf ſhall perceive no ſmell that ſhall offend him; the ſmell of Garlick is not offenſive to thoſe who have eaten of it.</p>
                     <p>Now to conclude this my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> if you perceive any ſuch <hi>Fiſtula</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, or to tend to a cancroſity, which you ſhall diſcern by the ſigns ſet down, when I delivered unto you the Prognoſticks: then uſe this Medicament of <hi>Heurmus</hi> the Father, ſet down in <hi>methodo ad praxin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 106. which he purchaſed both with Money and Entreaty, of one who got much Money by it.</p>

Of which <hi>Cornelius Celſus l.</hi> 7. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius Paraeus l.</hi> 9. <hi>ca.</hi> 31. and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius ab aqua pendente de operat. Chirurgic. part.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 47. have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                     <p>This kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi> happens two manner of ways: Firſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a penetrating wound of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by a Phlegmon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the intercoſtal Muſcles, and the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a ſuperfluous matter to ſet down any figus, ſeeing they appear to they Eye. and are eaſily found out, by applying the ſigns ſet down in the general method of curing of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, to every <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in particular.</p>
                     <p>As for the differences; a <hi>Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> enſuing a wound penetrating to the Cavity of the Breaſt, hath but one Orifice, the paſſage and ſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity whereof is according to the penetration of the wound; but a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> following after an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme, hath frequently more Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſices than one; whereof ſome paſs to the Cavity of the Breaſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome windingly.</p>
                     <p>To come to the Preſages. All <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Breaſt are hard to be cured, and that for ſeven rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Firſt, the Breaſt is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion by reaſon of its dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and contraction cauſed by the intercoſtal Muſcles: now, that motion hinders the curation of any Sore, it is ſo manifeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by experience, that it needs no proof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, becauſe in penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Breaſt, the <hi>Pleura</hi> is always ulcerate; which being thin, without Blood and membranous as the Bladder, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitts any conſolidation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, ſeeing the <hi>Virus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> doth often corrupt the Rib; and ſeeing the internal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Rib is cavernous and ſo apt to lodge corrupt Matter, the difficulty of curing is increaſed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Breaſt, the end of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is often lower than the Orifice, which hinders the expurgation of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous matter.</p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:52816:75"/>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifthly, the Sinuoſity within, in penetrating <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extend it ſelf between the <hi>Pleura</hi> and the upper Rib, to the diſtance between it and the lower Rib. Now how hard a matter it is to cleanſe this Cavity, I refer it to your own conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Sixthly, that liberty of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Medicaments, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in ſundry other parts of the Body, is here denied, the Lungs and Heart being lodged in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, whereof ſpecial regard is to be had, ſeeing upon the ſafety of theſe parts the life of the <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> depends.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Seventhly, becauſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s bring an extenuation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a Hectick Fever.</p>
                     <p>Let this be the ſecond Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick: If the party afflicted with a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in the Breaſt, be fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Hectick Fever, and his Body begin to be extenuate, pronounce the grief to be incurable; for if you uſe deſiccative means, which are required in curing of Ulcers, you ſhall increaſe theſe ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical griefs, and haſten death.</p>
                     <p>The third prediction <hi>Celſus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers unto us in theſe words, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quoque, &amp;c. Fiſtula</hi>'s uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when they have paſſed by the Ribs, to corrupt the Midriſf; which may be gathered by the place affected, and the greatneſs of pain; in this caſe there is no hopes of cure.</p>
                     <p>As for the cure of a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Breaſt; to it three means are required; a convenient Diet, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Decoctions, and local Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. In a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> which hath cauſed neither a Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor extenuation of the Body, a greater variety of Meats is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, than when theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are annexed. Howſoever Meats of eaſie concoction, and which afford laudable nouriſhment, are to be appointed for the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and a moderate uſe of them is to be preſcribed: of theſe two means I have ſpoken amply enough, when I ſet down the general cure of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>As for pectoral Decoctions, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uſe of which the greateſt part of the cure of ſuch <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s depends, you ſhall find divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of them in divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                     <p>The Simples whereof theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are made, are theſe; The Flowers and Leaves of Colts-foot, Maiden-hair, white Horehound, Comfrey, Tormentil, and Biſtort-roots, Violet-flowers, Borage roots and flowers, Elecampane-roots, Hyſſop, Germander, the flowers and roots of Mallows, the roots of Parſley and Fennel, Liquorice, Scabious, Valerian, Burnet, Sarſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parilla, Guajacum, <hi>China</hi>-root, Raiſins of the Sun, and blew Figs: of theſe Simples you ſhall find ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Decoctions ſet down by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have written of Wounds and <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all others, the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decoction of <hi>Franciſcus Arcaeus</hi> you may moſt ſafely and ſecurely truſt unto: He, while he lived, was ſo fortunate in the practice of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, that he drew that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Linguiſt and Divine <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> very often to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of his Operation. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction I need not ſet down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you may fetch it out of the Author himſelf, who is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52816:76"/>into the Engliſh Tongue.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſtick to commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you one of my own, whereof I have ſundry times made expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.

Marvel not at this quantity, for a leſs will little avail; for ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccation is required in this Cure.</p>
                     <p>Three things hinder the cure of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s:</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, is the inconvenient ſituation of the Orifice, when it is higher than the ending of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second is the extenuation of the Body.</p>
                     <p>And the Third is a Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Of theſe in order.</p>
                     <p>If then the ending of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> be lower than the external Orifice, a lower Orifice is to be made by inciſion. In this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion two things are to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted: The Firſt is the place. The Second, the cautions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Section.</p>
                     <p>As for the regions of the Breaſt: The Left Side is ſafer than the Right: for in this Side the Liver by its gibboſity beareth up the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and inſinuates it ſelf to the cavity of the Breaſt: If then either one of theſe, or both ſhould be wounded imprudently, it is an eaſie matter to prognoſticate the tragical event of this operation.</p>
                     <p>As for the determinate part of the Breaſt, which is to be opened, let it be about the beginning of the next Rib, and not at the lower end of that Rib, above which the orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> ſhews it ſelf; for under it are couched a Vein, a Nerve, and an Artery.</p>
                     <p>In your Section proceed thus: Firſt, divide the Skin towards the upper part of the lower Rib, then make way thorowout the interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Muſcles: Theſe things being done, dry all things with a Sponge, and put into the new Orifice a ſwelling Sponge, both to dilate it, and to draw to it ſelf the Quittour. If you go thus to work, you need not fear any danger, if you paſs no further than the diviſion of the <hi>Pleura:</hi> ſo that neither the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> nor the Lungs, nor the <hi>Pericardium</hi> be touched.</p>
                     <p>If with a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Breaſt a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> or Hectick Fever be complicate, the difficulty of curing is exceedingly increaſed; two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes joyntly conſpiring to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the diſeaſed Party, which notwithſtanding for their Cure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire adverſe indications, the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> requiring Deſiccation, and <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> and the Hectick Fever craving Humectation. If then a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Breaſt be offered to any one, Firſt of all be ſparing in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52816:76"/>your promiſes, leſt ye be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clouds without Rain: who but an Ignorant will give free reins to liberal promiſes to cure a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Breaſt, complicate with other Deutero-pathetical griefs, of their own nature hard to be cured, when as it is a difficult matter to cure a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the part?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> in Latine Authors <hi>Marcor,</hi> is an immoderate drineſs and conſumption of the whole body. by reaſon of the defect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Humidity, according to <hi>Trallianus.</hi> According to <hi>Galen. li. de marc.</hi> there are two degrees of it: The one is when this extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Body is in <hi>Fieri,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming; the other is when it is in <hi>Facto eſſe,</hi> or conſummate.</p>
                     <p>If it be in <hi>Fieri</hi> only, the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles begin to fall, the Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomes flaggy and looſe, ſtrength and agility decay, and the party finds a manifeſt defect, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in all the actions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether they be animal, vital, or natural. Againſt this degree you may contend by inſtituting a Diet moiſtening.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> be in <hi>Facto eſſe,</hi> or conſummate; then the Eyes grow hollow, and ſeem to be hid in the pits; the lively colour of the skin fades, the skin of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſeems dry, and ſtretched like the head of a Drum; the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids ſeem heavy, and ſcarce able to lift themſelves up, as it happens to thoſe who are wearied by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of watching; the Temples are hollow: in the cavities of the Breaſt and Belly, one would think that there were neither <hi>Viſcera,</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers contained, nor Guts: for the Muſcles are ſo conſumed, and the Cavities ſo drawn in, that nothing ſeems to remain beſides the <hi>Fibrae</hi> and the Skin. To conclude, one having a conſummate <hi>Maraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſeems to be nothing elſe but a walking <hi>Skeleton.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall undertake the cure of ſuch a one, and perform it, I will give him leave to give himſelf out for another Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to publiſh a Fifth Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Maraſmus</hi> is two-fold: for one is accompanied with heat, and may be called a dry <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> and this is nothing elſe but a Hect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Fever, which has conſumed the radical moiſture of the ſolid parts, and it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or an extenuating Fever.</p>
                     <p>The other is accompanied with Cold. This is two-fold: The one is natural, and it is decrepit old age: for old age is defined by drineſs and coldneſs.</p>
                     <p>The other is unnatural, and it is called <hi>Senium ex morbo,</hi> a decay by reaſon of ſickneſs: old age comes by the courſe of time.</p>
                     <p>This laſt is of a violent cauſe, for it follows after a burning or a Hectick Fever; and that by reaſon of the ſickneſs it ſelf, or by reaſon of Medicaments uſed in the curing of the afore-named griefs: for a Hectick Fever does not only waſt the natural Humidity, but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat alſo ſeated in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity: wherefore the Heart it ſelf, the wel-ſpring of this heat, muſt become colder than it ought to be. In this caſe the Pulſe is ſmall and weak, and ſlow: in like manner the breathing is weak, ſlow and cold. By reaſon of the uſe of refrigerating Medicaments appointed by the Phyſician in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Hectick, or a <hi>Febris
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52816:77"/>Maraſmodes,</hi> many times <hi>Senium ex morbo</hi> ſucceeds: and this is more intolerable, becauſe, the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat immoderately cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the leſs of the Radical Moiſture is ſpent, than would be, if the Hectick had its full courſe.</p>
                     <p>A Hectick Fever, is an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat which has ſeized upon the ſolid parts, and waſtes the Moiſture of them. But ſeeing there is a three-fold Moiſture in the Body: to wit, Blood in the ſmall-Veins and Arteries of every part, a dewy ſubſtance in every part by which it is nouriſhed, and <hi>gluten</hi> which keeps together the Terreſtrial ſubſtance of each part, moiſtens it, and keeps it from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to duſt:</p>
                     <p>There are alſo three degrees of a Hectick. In the beginning when the two firſt Humidities begin to fail, the Hectick Fever is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned, although it may be without great difficulty cured: But if the Radical Moiſture be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, as it is eaſily diſcerned, ſo it is hardly cured. As long as this Moiſture is ſomewhat plentiful, ſufficient to entertain the Natural Heat, the Body ſeems well colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of a comely Figure, and of a decent quantity.</p>
                     <p>If therefore you perceive the Body of any one having a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in the Breaſt, by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this <hi>gluten,</hi> or Radical Moiſture, become diſcoloured, the Figure to be altered, ſome parts bunching out, ſome growing hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the thickneſs of the Members to become ſlenderer, the Fleſh colliquating; leave ſuch a one to himſelf, that he may march peaceably to the period of his life.</p>
                     <p>Having treated of a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> or extenuation of the Body, and a Hectick Fever (ſo much as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you to know in your Chirurgical Practice) without the knowledge of which, you cannot poſſibly proceed, warily and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, in curing <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Breaſt, I am to ſhew you what uſes you may make of what hath been delivered.</p>
                     <p>If therefore one having a <hi>Fistula</hi> in the Breaſt, be brought unto you, whoſe Body ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Skin and Bone, (as the vulgar proverb is) acquaint him with the danger wherein he is, leſt death ſeize upon him unprepared. Nevertheleſs if he implore your aid of Chriſtian Charity, withdraw not what comfort you are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure unto him; appoint then a Diet moiſtning and nouriſhing, if no Phyſician be at hand, which I will ſet down anon; and dreſs him with thoſe Medicaments, which are anodyne and healing. Inject into the <hi>Fistula</hi> Plantain-water, having ſome red Roſe-leaves dried mingled with it; cover your Tent and Pledget with <hi>Diachylon ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex.</hi> If you perceive that there is ſo much of the Radical Moiſture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as is able to cheriſh the Natural Heat (which you ſhall diſcern, if the colour of the Body be freſh, if the Figure be decent, if the proportion of the parts be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed party can in ſome good meaſure perform all actions) you may conceive ſome hope of his recovery.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> has extenuated his Body, appoint for him a Diet which is likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52816:77"/>the Natural Moiſture impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let him then take Broths made of Mutton, Veal or Chickens, wherein Damask Prunes, Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned, Currans waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bruiſed, Mallow-flowers and Roots, Marigold-flowers, Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foil, Cowſlip-flowers, and Colts-foot-leaves and flowers have been boiled: Gellies are good, made of young Cockrels, and a Knuckle of Veal; uſe no other Spice to it than a little Mace and Nutmeg. Let him between meals take Almond-Milk made of Broth of a Chicken boiled with French-Barley. It is good for him alſo every Morning and Evening, to take a draught of Aſſes or Goats Milk: or in want of theſe, of Cows Milk, milked thorow the Conſerves of Borrage, and Bugloſs flowers; Calves and Sheeps-feet ſtewed with Currans are good: ſometimes let him eat Pigs-fleſh. If he have a mind to Fiſh, grant unto him Whiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mops, Smelts, Perches, young Pickerels, Trouts, yea ſometimes Eels: the Sole, Flownder and Plaice may alſo be permitted; poched Eggs, and ſweet Butter without any Salt, or Almond-But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are good for break-faſt.</p>
                     <p>If an extenuation of the Body do proceed from an Hectick Fever, then you muſt not only moiſten the Body, but cool it alſo. In the Broths then boil Borage, and Succory Roots, common Sorrel, wood Sorrel, Primroſe, Violet, Borrage, and Bugloſs-flowers: let his Sallets be Lettuce, Spinage, and Purſelain boiled in Chicken-broth. An Almond-milk made of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of French Barley, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Emulſion of the Seeds of the Pompion, Musk-melon, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber, Purſelain, and White Poppy has been drawn, is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent taken Morning and Evening. Permit no Milk but Butter-milk, and that when it begins to be a little ſowriſh, with a little of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or Borage, or Bugloſs. If the diſeaſed party complain of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate heat, and watching, give him twice a week <hi>Philoninum Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum,</hi> with Syrup of white Poppy, red Poppy, Gilly-flowers, Maiden-hair, Colts-foot, or of the juice of Limons, or Citrons in <hi>Aqua Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis Ranarum</hi> or red Poppy. If you perceive that by the following of theſe courſes the party has reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſtrength, and a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, then you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a good hope of his recovery, and put him in good comfort, and ſo boldly proceed in the Cure, ſtill endeavouring by following the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications (as <hi>Theſcus</hi> did the Thread of <hi>Ariadne</hi> to come out of the Labyrinth) to reſtore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>In ſetting down of local Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations I will be brief, becauſe they little differ from the general, if you except a few obſervations. You may ſafely dilate a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Breaſt, with the <hi>Fistula</hi> Tent and Sponge; but in removing of the <hi>Callus</hi> you muſt he wary; for if you apply the Trochisk, it muſt not reach to the Cavity of the Breaſt; for the point of it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, break, and fall upon the <hi>Septum tranſverſum,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly will erode it, cauſe an Inflammation, procure a ſharp Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a <hi>Paraphrenitis,</hi> and at laſt death it ſelf. Apply then a Tent armed with <hi>Populeon,</hi> wherewith
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52816:78"/>the <hi>Fistula</hi> Powder muſt be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, as hath been taught. The <hi>Callus</hi> being removed, mundifie the Ulcer with <hi>Aqua calcis,</hi> and <hi>Mel roſatum</hi> mingled together: Take heed that you inject no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Medicament, for ſuch Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are eaſily ſucked in by the Lungs, from whence by the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaea Arteria</hi> they eaſily paſs to the Throat and Mouth, from whence there is felt a horrible bitterneſs, a deſire to vomit, and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Appetite, <hi>Paraeus lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 13. affirms this to have happened unto him twice, be you ware by the example of others. The Ulcer having been mundified, proceed to conſolidation; for ſores in this part are not to be long kept open: This you ſhall procure by injecting two or three days the Syrup of red Roſe-leaves dried, mingled with Plantain-water; and then only moiſtning a Pledget wet in this Syrup, or the Syrup of Myrtles. Above the Pledget ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his Styptick <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtrum;</hi> for in this caſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all others: becauſe it not only draws the brims together, but it skins alſo.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the Belly and Joynts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>FIſtula</hi>'s of the Belly are two-fold: for they are either in the <hi>Inguinal</hi> parts, or elſe in <hi>Ano.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of theſe in the Groins I will diſcourſe; becauſe they moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall out, being Accidents, for the moſt part, which enſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Venereal <hi>Bubo</hi>'s, either neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ill cured; yea, they fall out in Plethorick and Cacochymical Bodies very often, wherein there is no Neapolitane Seed: and that ſomewhat above the Emunctory it ſelf; the Matter not coming to the Emunctories themſelves, which receive the Excrements of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but being hindered, either by reaſon of the weakneſs of the expulſive faculty, or by the croſſing and thwarting of the Muſcles, oblique and tranverſe in thoſe places, as they who are skilful in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my well know. It is no wonder that both Abſceſſes, and <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s often fall out in theſe places, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Belly is as a Draught or Sink in a Houſe, or a Keel in a Ship, whither all impurities flow. Yea, ſuch plenty of ſharp Humors ſometimes flows to theſe parts, that perforation of the Guts is cauſed, and that the Excrements come out at the Orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula;</hi> a lamentable caſe, noiſome to the diſeaſed party, and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52816:78"/>to the company. It falls out ſometimes that ſome of the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> of the <hi>Spina</hi> are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                     <p>As for the Preſages: <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in theſe places, which paſs to the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> are hardly cured.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the Liver is ſtill apt to afford new Matter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection is to be uſed, if you ſhall uſe either Inciſion, or Corroſive Medicaments, by reaſon of the <hi>Fibrae</hi> of the Muſcles, and the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and <hi>Aorta</hi> deſcending.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Preſage is this: If the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Spina</hi> be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, pronounce the <hi>Fistula</hi> to be incurable: you ſhall conjecture the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> to be foul, if extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtore of ſtinking <hi>Sanies</hi> iſſue out of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and the party daily grow weaker, and more extenuate, notwithſtanding that you uſe all convenient both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external means.</p>
                     <p>The third Preſage ſhall be this; If the Guts be eroded, and the Excrements come out at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> the life of the diſeaſed party is in great hazard: becauſe the Guts are thin, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, and deſtitute of ſtore of Blood.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is apt to creep thorow the diſtances between the Muſcles, which in thoſe places are many; to wit, the oblique and tranſverſe, one placed above another.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe in curing ſuch <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, we find little help of Hand and Eye.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe topical means can hardly be kept to the Guts, to help conſolidation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure of theſe <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi>'s: If they be not deep, but run along ſuperficially, the beſt courſe is to make inciſion, and then to apply one of the <hi>Fistula</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deſcribed by me, care had of the age and conſtitution of the party.</p>
                     <p>As for the Mundification, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation, and Cicatrization of ſuch, ſeeing no ſpecial obſervation is required, you are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to that, which I have copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delivered heretofore. If the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Spina</hi> be foul, you are to promiſe no Cure.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if perſons of worth will (upon good conſideration) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you to dreſs them, they finding a comfort by your pains, make an injection of Plantain, or <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> Water, adding ſome fragrant Water of Medow-ſweet, the Syrup of red Roſe-leaves dried, and the Spirit of Wine, having the tincture of Aloe, Myrrhe, Maſtick, and ſome Saffron. Let your Emplaſter be <hi>Diachylon cum gummi,</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. If the Guts fall out to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated, having acquainted the friends of the party with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet deſpair not, but go on, and uſe Methodical means. Let the party eat Calves and Sheeps-feet ſtewed, Sheeps and Calves heads; for they afford a glutinous juice; Rice boiled in Milk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Steel hath been often quenched, is alſo good. Every Morning and Evening let the party take a draught of Allegant, warmed with a Wheat Toaſt, when he has drunk off the Wine, let him eat
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52816:79"/>the Toaſt. Make injection of red Wine, having a little Alume diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in it, and ſome of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Myrtle-berries: keep the Orifice open with a Sponge, until the Gut be conſolidate: then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the extirpation of the <hi>Gallus,</hi> Mundification, Conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Cicatrization, as has been heretofore taught. Event oftentimes falls out above expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Not long ago a Country Youth, who had an <hi>Enterocele,</hi> was bound to a Barber in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet;</hi> one applying to the Rupture a Truſs ſomewhat ſtrait, cauſed a Sideration or Mortification of the part, ſo that the Excrements came out plentifully, with much ſtinking Matter out of the Cavity of the Belly. Notwithſtanding, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and application of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means, the Gut was conſolidate and the Youth kept alive. So much I thought good to deliver concerning the Cure of <hi>Fistula</hi>'s, which happen in the Inguinal Region.</p>
                     <p>Now it follows, that I ſpeak of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in <hi>Ano</hi> which was ſaid to be the ſecond kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>This kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi> very often follows after a Plegmon in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> broken and ill cured.</p>
                     <p>There be two ſorts of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, for ſome pierce not the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and ſome do: and both theſe are either ſhallow or deep.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall conjecture the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> to paſs thorow the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum:</hi> Firſt, if after breaking of Wind, part of it make way thorow the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Excrements ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear mingled with the Quittour, or if the Quittour ſmell as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements uſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, injection being made at the outer Orifice of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula,</hi> if part of it paſs within the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the foregoing being put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> if you feel the Probe bare, it being thruſt thorow the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> this is an infallible and certain ſign.</p>
                     <p>As for the Preſages of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s: Firſt, no <hi>Fiſtula ani</hi> is eaſie to cure: for this part being the Jakes of the Body, it affords great plenty of Impurities, and much ſuperfluous Moiſture, which hinder the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in this place be not very painful and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, by reaſon of much ſtinking Quittour, but ſhuts and opens it ſelf ſundry times. It is expedient for the health of the Patient, if ſuch a one be left uncured: for by this means the Body is diſcharged of ſuperfluous Humors, and the Body kept in health. I have known this Accident to have happened to ſundry, and to have continued to the end of their lives.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to the Cure of theſe <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s: The means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this are five: Diet, internal Medicaments, Inciſion, Deligation and Topical means.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diet, and internal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, I have diſcourſed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently heretofore.</p>
                     <p>As for Inciſion and Deligation, they have place when the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is ſhallow; but if the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52816:79"/>deep, neither of theſe means are to be attempted.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and paſs not to the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> after you have dilated it, and removed the <hi>Callus,</hi> upon a Tent, inciſe all the hollowneſs: then fill it with Doſels, armed with a Medicament made of a reſtrictive Powder, and the white of an Egg, to keep the brims of the inciſed parts aſunder; for if you go about to unite the parts too ſoon, it may be feared that a Cavity will ſtill remain, and make way for Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divation: wherefore it behoves you, to ſee that ſound and laudable Fleſh be ingendred in the bottom. Let not your incarnative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be ſatty, for ſuch will cauſe looſe and ſpongy Fleſh: uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sanative Syrup made of vulnerary Plants, having ſome <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis cephalieus</hi> mingled with it. If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> go deep inwardly, ſo that you cannot uſe conveniently inciſion, dilate the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> Tent, and the Sponge: then remove the <hi>Callus</hi> with a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> Trochisk; the Trochisk being come out, and the <hi>Callus</hi> quite ſpent, mundifie it with <hi>Mel roſatum,</hi> mingled with <hi>Aqua cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis:</hi> when you perceive laudable Quittour, endeavour to conſolidate the part, by applying the Sanative Syrup, and <hi>Pulvis cephalicus</hi> upon the Tents, which you muſt day by day ſhorten, until at laſt the whole <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is ſhut up; which you ſhall conjecture by the little and laudable Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour which the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> yields. Then nothing elſe remains, but to cicatrize the part with your <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de minio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> penetrate to the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> then cutting aſunder of the whole <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> by deligation is moſt fit. But firſt of all, you muſt dilate the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and remove the <hi>Callus</hi> (as has been ſaid) for ſo the part which is to be bound will be more thin, and ſo more eaſily cut aſunder. As for the Thread wherewith you are to bind the <hi>Sinus,</hi> two I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you: Firſt, Sealing Thread, which is made of the beſt Hemp, unboiled, and unwhiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For is is exceeding ſtrong, and will not rot before it hath wrought its effect. The ſecond, is a ſtrong Thread of Silk, twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is no great Matter in the colour, whatſoever ſcrupulous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirm: you may uſe either of theſe as opportunity ſhall be offered.</p>
                     <p>When you go about to bind the <hi>Sinus,</hi> put in one end of the Thread in the Eye of a ſmall and flexible Probe, then thruſt the Eye with the Thread thorow the <hi>Sinus</hi> into the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum:</hi> this being done, put into the <hi>Anus</hi> your Finger, and with it pull the Thread out of the Eye of the Probe, and draw it out at the <hi>Anus,</hi> or having bent the Eye of the Probe, bring it without the <hi>Anus,</hi> and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Thread into the Eye, draw that end thorow the outer Orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> If the <hi>Sinus</hi> be not very thick and long, you may by one ſtrong Deligation bind off all the <hi>Sinus;</hi> but if the <hi>Sinus</hi> be thick and long, you muſt uſe ſundry conſtrictions, tying ſtill the ends of the Thread with a running knot, that it may be the more readily looſed. Some
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52816:80"/>after one Deligation only more and more draw in the ends of the Thread, with a round piece of a Stick turned about. When all the <hi>Sinus</hi> after diviſion by Deligation, lies open, go forward in the Cure, as has been ſet down, when the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was inciſed. <hi>Job à Meek'ren</hi> in his <hi>Obſ. Medico-Chir. Cap.</hi> 61. recites the following Caſe:
<q>
                           <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Volkertſen,</hi> a melancho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>k Man, after a great commotion of Mind, felt a defluxion run along his Back down to his Rump, and from thence to the meeting of the Buttocks, where the <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum</hi> lies upon the <hi>Os Caude.</hi> Preſently a ſwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, which perforated the fat, the edge of the Muſcle <hi>Glutaeus,</hi> and the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum.</hi> When I came to the Patient, beſides the Fever I conſidered the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Pain, the hardneſs of the Tumor, its redneſs and extenſion. And becauſe I knew theſe and other ſymptoms muſt be aſcribed to the Tumor, I preſently applied this Cataplaſm, to promote Maturation; ℞ <hi>Rad. Alth. Bryon. Lilior. alb. an.</hi> ℥ jſs. <hi>Fol.

The ſecond day I thought it adviſable to open it, and a great quantity of foetid purulent Matter ran out. Afterwards I obſerved Wind and Excrements to come out at the Tumor, whence I concluded, the Gut was perforated. I applied ſeveral things to regenerate Fleſh; but to no purpoſe. Therefore I was forced to Inciſion, in which I was obliged to cut the reſt of the Gut that was ſound, the Skin, and a Muſculous portion of the Gut. When the diſſection was done, becauſe there was a grievous flux of Blood after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Haemorrhoidal Veins, I applied an ordinary Aſtringent to the Wound. The next day I found leſs <hi>Pus</hi> than uſual in the Wound. All things promiſed well and ſo they ſucceeded: for he was perfectly ſound.</q> Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains to conclude theſe diſcourſes of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, but to ſpeak ſomewhat of the curing of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the Joints. Theſe griefs, what pains they procure to the Patients, and troubles to the Chirurgeons who dreſs them, it is ſo well known to thoſe who have been imployed in ſuch buſineſſes, that I need not uſe many words to perſwade any to believe this: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hearing witneſs.</p>
                     <p>The differences of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s are theſe. Some are without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Bones and Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and ſome have theſe annexed.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſome of theſe are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Tumor of the adjacent parts, and in ſome there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſwelling of the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent; ſo that the Skin it ſelf is either brawny and hard, or looſe and Oedematous; and ſome of the Tendons of the Muſcles are foul, and corrupted very often: ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors often fall out, when <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> happen in the Wriſts and Ankles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in ſome of theſe <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi>'s the Joint abides firm; but in ſome it becomes looſe and weak
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52816:80"/>by reaſon of the relaxation of the Membrane which covers it, and the Ligament by which it is ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to Prognoſticate of the Events, let me acquaint you with one thing, and that is this; that if ye be called to Children or Young Perſons troubled with a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> or <hi>Fistula</hi>'s in the Joint or Joints, that you make trial of the <hi>Sinus</hi> with a Mallow ſtalk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it; for this kind of probation is of all others leſs pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and will incourage the diſeaſed perſons to commit themſelves to your care, when they perceive that you ſearched the Sores ſo eaſily, hoping that your proceedings will be according to your beginning. The ſmall ſtalk of the Mallow next to the Leaf is always ſlimy and flexible, and ſo is apt to ſlip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sinus,</hi> cauſing either no pain, or very little.</p>
                     <p>As for the Preſages: 1. No <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> of the Joint, although it be without corruption of the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages or Bones, is of an eaſie Cure: for firſt by reaſon of the pain, which is cauſed by reaſon of the ſenſibleneſs of the part, and the increaſe of it by reaſon the ſharp Medicaments which muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to remove the <hi>Callus,</hi> ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomatical Fevers, loſs of Appetite, watching, extenuation of the Body, and at laſt a Hectick Fever may be procured.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the Elbow or Knee have corruption, either of the Cartilages or Bones, annexed, it will require long time to have it cured: for the joints themſelves being very ſenſible, it muſt be gently dreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If in <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s of the Wriſt the bones of it, or of the back of the Hand, be carious, you ſhall find the Cure to be difficult: for theſe Bones are very ſpongy, apt to receive ſuperfluous Humidity, and ſo are hard to be ſcaled.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For theſe ſame Reaſons, the Bones of the Joint of the foot, and the Inſtep are hard to be cured.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the Wriſt or Inſtep be accompanied with large and hard Tumors of the Bands and Feet, pronounce the Cure to be uncurable: for then the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, Tendons of the Muſcles, and Bones commonly are corrupt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If an extenuation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or a Hectick Fever do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the great Joints, ſhun the Cure: for the Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of curing, which preſcribe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cooling, in drying increaſe theſe griefs. Beſides this, complicate Diſeaſes are more hardly cured then thoſe which are ſolitary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If you ſhall demand of me, what courſe is to be taken with thoſe who are poſſeſſed with ſuch incurable</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula<hi>'s, If you be intreated of the diſeaſed party, or the parties friends to do your beſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that if after ſome trial, you perceive the party to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, you ought to move the party to ſuffer extirpation and diſmembring of the Limb, whether it be Foot or Arm, before he grow weak, and become unable to endure any ſuch operation. In young perſons you may attempt this operation (for I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured it with good ſucceſs) but in aged and craſie perſons be not too
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52816:81"/>bold; for the loſs of the Radical Moiſture is more eaſily, by Diet and Medicaments, reſtored in thoſe, then theſe: the other may, but theſe muſt die.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to the Topical means, which are convenient for the curing of <hi>Piſtula</hi>'s in the Joints (for as concerning the Diet, and internal Medicaments, I have ſpoken of them ſufficiently already) you muſt note that you muſt have good Anodyne Cataplaſms to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain, and good, eaſie, and effectual means to remove the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> If you apply Mercury ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or Arſenick to remove the Calloſity of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s in the great Joints, you ſhall always cauſe a ſymptomatical Fever, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a mortification of the part, if the party be of a Cacochymical conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>As for the means which miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate pain, I commend unto you <hi>Fallopius</hi> his Cataplaſm, which he deſcribes in his Treatiſe of Ulcers, <hi>c.</hi> 17. And it is this: ℞ <hi>Ol. Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric. Chamaem, &amp; Aneth. an.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Furfur. flor. Chamaem. Farin. hord.

                        <p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving delivered unto you, what I thought pertinent of compound Ulcers without Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Method requires that I ſpeak fully in like manner of Malign Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Malign is that, which differing from ordinary Ulcers, is not eaſily cured. By <hi>Gal. de Criſib. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. not Ulcers only, but all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which have a Malignity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. As a mild Grief has a mild Cauſe, and no horrible or extraordinary ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and yields to ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments; ſo that which is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign has a fierce Cauſe, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſymptoms, and yields not to ordinary Medicaments. Theſe Malign Ulcers do happen, when ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> hath poſſeſſed the ulcerate part, that it corrupts the good nouriſhment which is ſent to the part affected. The Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent to the part is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, either by putrefaction, or a venenious quality commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Then the ſigns of a Malign Ulcer are three: Firſt, it corrupts the part which it invadeth, either by Putrefaction, or a Malign fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quality.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It cauſes extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Symptoms, as pain and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of virulent ſtinking Matter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It yields not to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>The differences of Malign Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are theſe: Firſt, theſe Ulcers are either Ancient or Modern. I call theſe Ancient, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by the Antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: thoſe I call Modern, which were only known to late Writers: ſuch are thoſe Ulcers which appear in ſcorbutical, and pocky perſons, whereof I mean not to ſpeak in this Doctrine of Ulcers, becauſe they are ſymptoms of the Scurvy and Pox, which cannot be cured unleſs the Griefs themſelves be cured. Now the ſetting down of the Cure of the Diſeaſes, will require large and particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.</p>
                     <p>Of malign Ulcers known to the Ancients, ſome are leſs Malign, ſome more Malign.</p>
                     <p>Of the leſs Malign there are three ſorts: <hi>Herpes exedens, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedaena</hi> and <hi>Nome. Herpes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> in Greek, being cauſed of thick and ſharp Choler, it corrodes the Skin even to the ſubjacent muſculous Fleſh. It differs from <hi>Phagedaena,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52816:82"/>it erodes the skin only; but <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedaena,</hi> both the skin and ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fleſh. <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 5. and <hi>c.</hi> 28. thus deſcribes it: <hi>Herpes. fit cum cutis exulceratione, &amp; eſt ſine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine, latus, ſublividus, inaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis tamen, mediumque ſaneſcit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis affectis, &amp;c.</hi> That is, a <hi>Herpes</hi> is cauſed when the skin is ulcerate. It is not deep, but broad, of a livid colour, uneven notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the middle heals, the bruns remaining ſore. Wherefore if you perceive an Ulcer to ſpread and cauſe ſundry other ſmall Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which reach no deeper than the skin, you may pronounce it to be <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> or <hi>Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ambulativa;</hi> or <hi>Corroſiva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted in the words of <hi>Celſus,</hi> that a <hi>Herpes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edens</hi> may be of a livid colour; and ſo with thick and corrupt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler that melancholy muſt be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is bred of <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> and ſo it muſt ſomewhat participate with a cancerous Ulcer. And in truth ſuch Ulcers often ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in old perſons about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the tails of the Muſcles of the Legs; and from theſe a moiſt, noiſome and ſtinking viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter will flow, and the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer it ſelf will be very painful, and rebellious.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns then of a <hi>Formica cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſiva</hi> are theſe: It only corrodes the skin, and ſo is not deep, but broad; uneven it is, and ſometimes of a livid or leaden colour, if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy cauſed of <hi>Bilis atra</hi> be joyned with thick and putrid cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: otherwiſe the brims of this Ulcer, and the parts adjacent are of a yellowiſh colour, bewraying the Humor, which is the material cauſe of this kind of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks: Firſt, that <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> which is cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only of thick and putrid choler, is not eaſily cured. For Firſt, the Body which is troubled with ſuch an Ulcer, is not ſo ſoon altered; for the Liver, the Gall it ſelf, and the <hi>Porus bilarius</hi> muſt be much out of frame, when they cannot make ſhift to diſpatch this Humor, by the paſſages appointed for the Evacuations of it; to wit, by the Guts, and paſſages of the Urine; but ſuffer it to paſs by the habit of the Body by the Veſſels which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nouriſhment; to wit, Veins and Arteries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe this Humor being altogether contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it cauſes a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the part, by which the profitable nouriſhment which is ſent to the part, for preſervation of it, is corrupted: and ſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the part affected is defrauded of Aliment, but the parts adjacent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are drawn to the ſame ſociety of corruption.</p>
                     <p>Let this be the third Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick: If a ſincere <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> proceeding only of thick putrid Choler, be hardly cured, as hath been proved; then if <hi>Bilis atra</hi> be annexed, ſurely the cure muſt be much more hard; for this is a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which cauſes more fearful ſymptomes; as extream pain, greater corroſion, and rebellion to ordinary Medicaments: and if the Body has gotten a habit of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; it is hard, without rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to reduce it to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution, and to hinder the provent and increaſe of it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts promiſe much, but for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52816:82"/>the moſt part they prove Clouds without Rain.</p>
                     <p>The Alchymiſt will have the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and material cauſes of all Ulcers, to be the ſuperfluity of the Salt of the natural Balſame of the Body, conſiſting of a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt, Sulphur, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>
                     <p>This ſuperfluous Salt being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the natural Balſame by the expelling faculty, it is turned ſometimes to one, and ſometimes to another part of the body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is apt no be moved, according to its thinneſs or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, volatility or fixation.</p>
                     <p>It ſetling in the part, is more coagulate and calcined (the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling faculty not being able to expel it by the Pores of the Skin) and ſo it acquires a certain corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and is the cauſe of thoſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which have no maligne qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity accompanying the Salt. They will have a volatil and ſubtil Salt, ſuch as is in the Nettle, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, to be the cauſe of an <hi>Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ly repreſent to the eye of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the nature of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which dogmatical Phyſicians will have to be the cauſes of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. It is no hereſie to maintain either opinion; but he deſerves both credit and gain, who ſhall perform the cure of thoſe Ulcers, which he takes in hand. Moſt Patients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire rather ſpeedy and eaſie cure of their griefs, than learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of them. Howſoever, theſe diſcourſes are requiſite for you, who meeting ſometimes with ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Phyſicians and Patients, ſhall be drawn to ſhew your The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orical as well as your Practical parts.</p>
                     <p>As for the cure, Three intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are required to cure a <hi>Herpes exedens:</hi> The Firſt is, that the Humor which ſlows to the part be ſtayed. The Second is, that the Humor which is impacted in the part, be evacuated. The Third is, the Cure of the Ulcer it ſelf by convenient means.</p>
                     <p>The firſt intention, which is the ſtaying of the Humor from flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the part affected, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by purging of the Body from thick choler, and <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> if the <hi>Formica corroſiva</hi> be of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid colour.

                     <p>The Second intention in curing of <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> was ſaid to be the vacuation of the Humor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted in the part.

It is like, that he was fortunate in the curing of malign Ulcers, by reaſon of the great Skill which he had in the knowledge of the faculty of Plants. He lived but two 2690 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Creation of the World, that is, 77 years before the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Troy,</hi> which fell out <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 2767.

And it is not unlikely; for moſt Chirurgeons know the faculty of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> in cicatrizing of Rheumatick Ulcers, it drying ſtrongly without any ſharpneſs; unto which the ruſt of old Iron waſhed and prepared comes very near. So <hi>Achilles</hi> made ſufficient proof of his Skill in the Art of Chirurgery, which he learned of his Grand-father <hi>Chiron.</hi> Go to then, let effeminate Hind-calves deſpiſe the Art of Chirurgery, which, ſo eminent a Perſon as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> was, was not aſhamed to practiſe. From <hi>Achilles</hi> Millfod is called <hi>Sideritis Achillea, Achilles</hi> his Star-woort: and it may be that it was one of the chiefeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in the Cataplaſm; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is an excellent healing Plant. To conclude then this Point; malign Ulcers which are not eaſily cured, are called <hi>Chironia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Chiron</hi> was able to cure them; and <hi>Telephia,</hi> becauſe <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephus</hi> was troubled with ſuch an one.</p>
                     <p>Now time calls to go forward in the handling of theſe corroſive Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: but before I ſet down the manner of Curing, the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Events which are like to fall out in the courſe of Cure are firſt to be ſet down. I. Neither of theſe corroſive Ulcers are of eaſie Cure, upon what Body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they light; and upon three Cauſes: For firſt, there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> an ill conſtitution and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the part, by which the Aliment, which is ſent to the part, too it be good, is corrupted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a freſh ſupply of noxious
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52816:86"/>Humors is ſent moſt commonly to maintain the Grief. Thirdly, becauſe the ordinary Medicaments, which are applied with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs moſt commonly to other. Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in theſe Ulcers are ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. II. If theſe Ulcers light upon a Cacochymical Body, the caſe is yet worſe: for the Conſtitution of the Body muſt be altered before theſe Griefs can be cured, which is a matter of no ſmall difficulty. III. If theſe ſeiſe upon decrepit Perſons, the caſe is in a manner deſperate: for in ſuch the natural Heat is weak, and the Radical Moiſture almoſt ſpent: ſo that great ſtore of corrupt and ſaltiſh Humors are bred in the Bodies of ſuch, which being ſent to the weak parts ulcerate, increaſe theſe Griefs.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is performed by three means: to wit, a convenient Diet, internal Medicaments, and local Applications: As for the Diet, thoſe Meats and Drinks muſt be uſed which afford a landable Juice; whereof I have ſpoken before: and in that meaſure that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct them, that no ſuperfluities be bred. Beſides this, Meats which are eaſily corrupted in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach are to be ſhunned, as Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, Summer-fruits, and Salt Meats: ſlimy Fiſhes, and Swines fleſh are to be ſhunned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they afford no good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                     <p>Of internal Medicaments I mean not to ſpeak much. If a perſon troubled with an ordinary <hi>Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daena</hi> or <hi>Nome,</hi> be of ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and Plethorick, you may miniſter unto ſuch <hi>Hiera Diacolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthidos Magiſtralis;</hi> or <hi>Pilulae aggregativae Majores.</hi> If the party be weak, you may miniſter <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulae Stomachicae:</hi> Thoſe which I uſe are theſe: ℞ <hi>Aloes</hi>

The Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is very painful: Firſt, becauſe <hi>Atra bilis</hi> the material Cauſe of it is hot: Secondly, becauſe no heat can breath out, the ſubſtance of the Cancer being ſo compact. 5. It is round, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being thick, is not ſo apt to fleet abroad. 6. It is unequal, by reaſon of the ebullition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which notwithſtanding is not equally active in all parts of the Tumor. Laſt of all, a Cancer bath black or livid Veins extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the adjacent parts: for this atrabilious Humor cannot ſueat out of the Veins, which is the cauſe that they appear very full.</p>
                     <p>As for the parts which a Cancer invades, tho it may breed in all parts of the Body, yet it is moſt often ſeen in the Breaſts and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices</hi> of Women, and in the Lips and noſe of the Face.

                     <p>The Breaſts moſt promptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this atrabilious Humor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of glandulous and looſe ſubſtance. Beſides, the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi> Veins meet with the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Predictions before Curing, receive theſe: 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Cancers may appear in all the Quarters of the Year, yet moſt commonly they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the ending of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and during the whole time of the Harveſt: becauſe in theſe Seaſons Melancholy exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and Humors become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt. 2. No Cancer is eaſily cured; for if all ulcerate Cancers be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, according to <hi>Galen, c.</hi> 5. <hi>lib. de Atra bile;</hi> no cancerous Tumor can eaſily be cured, it having the ſame efficient Cauſe. 3. A Cancer not ulcerate, if it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52816:89"/>hath poſſeſſed any deep cavity of the Body, as the <hi>Matrix</hi> or <hi>Anus,</hi> it is not to be dealt withal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippoe. lib.</hi> 6, <hi>aphor.</hi> 38.</p>
                     <p>You muſt underſtand that he meaneth the curing by exciſion, cauſtical means, or uſtion: for the Ulcer will not admit cicatriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo the diſeaſed parties live in continual pain and filthineſs, and at the laſt die miſerably. But he forbids not the application of local means, which aſſwage pain and gently mundifie. 4. Cancerous Tumours in the outward parts, and only ſuperficial in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may be cured according to <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>ad Glaucon.</hi> 5. When cancerous Tumors are come to a remarkable bigneſs, they only can be cured by extirpation. 6. If a Cancer not ulcerate hath poſſeſſed the <hi>Matrix,</hi> the party feels great pain in the Groins, and hath often a difficulty in making of water: If the Cancer be ulcerate, it ſends out a loathſome and cadaverous ſmell, the vapour whereof aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Heart and Brain, cauſeth ſometimes fainting. 7. If the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted party be weak, and the cancerous Tumor be inveterate, or of a long continuance, it is not to be dealt withal with exciſion, adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or potential cautery: only lenitives are to be uſed, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a palliative cure: for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry have continued even to their decrepit old age, with a Cancer not ulcerate.</p>

                     <p>As for Phlebotomy, it has been obſerved, that the moſt conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But you may demand of me what Veins are to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I anſwer: If the Tumor be in the Lip, open the <hi>Cephalica;</hi> if it be in the Breaſts, open the <hi>Baſilica</hi> of the Right Arm, if it be in the Right Breaſt; and of the Left Arm, if it be in the Left Breaſt.

                     </p>

                     <p>Now having ſet down the cauſe of the name of a Cancer, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, the Signs, the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks, and the Dietetical, and Pharmaceutical means of curing of a Cancer not ulcerate, only the Chirurgical or Topical means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be ſet down.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing the conſtitution of Bodies is not uniform, and the grief it ſelf is of a moſt malign quality, variety of local Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is required: I will labour therefore to anſwer your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this: But firſt of all, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Cancer there is a double poiſon, as learned <hi>Heurnius</hi> upon the 36. Aphoriſm of the Sixth Book noteth: for the one is putrefactive, the other corroſive: If you apply hot and moiſt Medicaments, which uſually bring maturation in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes, you ſhall procure putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: if you apply corroſive Medicaments, you ſhall aſſiſt the other poiſon, and increaſe the Grief. Wherefore thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and digeſt, are apteſt, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> hath noted, 14 <hi>Method,</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no emplaſtick Medicaments can be good; for it hindreth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Of all things which give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to juices, Rye-meal and the Flower of Lupines are the beſt: for by a ſecret faculty they tame the fierceneſs of a Cancer. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then in the ſetting down of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal means, you may apply a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm made of the juice of Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Rye-flower, and ſome <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum populeum,</hi> or the juice of Comfrey with the flower of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines: you may uſe in like manner the juice of Horſe-tail, Knot-graſs, Plantain, Perwinckle, Shave-graſs, Millefoil, <hi>Tapſus barbatus,</hi> Clowns all-heal, and <hi>Dracontium.</hi>

                     <p>A cataplaſm of Snails and ground-Ivie is excellent. If the Tumor be very painful, apply a cataplaſm of the pulp of the roots of Henbane and Hemlock, with Rye-flower and ſome Oil of My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Of a cancerous Ulcer there are two differences, <hi>Lupus</hi> and <hi>Noli me tangere:</hi> that is in the Thigh or Leg, this in the Face. A Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in other parts of the Body has no particular denomination; but detains the general appellation, with addition of the part affected, as a Cancer of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that in other Countries, if a <hi>Lupus</hi> be troubleſome, they apply the fleſh of a Hen, Chicken; Pigeon, Whelp, or Kitling, out aſunder, according to the length; for ſo the fury of the Diſeaſe ceaſes, the malignity of the <hi>Sanies</hi> is eaſed, and the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſtai'd: See <hi>Riolan</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Parey</hi> in the places before cited.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw follows the Second kind of Ulcers moſt malign; to wit, a Leprous Ulcer. But firſt of all I will diſcourſe of the Leproſie it ſelf, and then of the nature of a Leprous Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The Leproſie in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Tongue is called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>ſcaber,</hi> rough: for it makes the skin rough and uneven: or from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>ſquama,</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> a ſcale or bark, becauſe it ſends out ſcales, and makes the skin rough like to the bark of a Tree. There be two ſorts of Leproſie: to wit, the Grecian and Arabian Leproſie.</p>
                     <p>The Grecian Leproſie may be thus deſcribed: It is <hi>a Tumor with a confirmed hot and dry diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the skin, both in the outer and inner part of it, wherein ſcales, like thoſe of fiſhes are ſent out:</hi> ſo that <hi>Pruritus, Scabies,</hi> and <hi>Lepra Graecorum</hi> the Itch, Scabbineſs, and the Grecian Leproſie differ only in degrees of Tumefaction: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature.</p>
                     <p>In itching there is no remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tumor, neither doth any thing fall away from the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be fetched away by hard ſcratching. In ſcabbineſs there is a remarkable Tumor, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſcratch or no, both ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matter and Scales like to the caſt skin of a Snake come away. In the Graecian Leproſie, there are greater Tumors than in ſcabbineſs, and Bodies like unto the ſcales of Fiſhes, fall from ſuch as are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this grief: ſo that <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar</hi> fitly calls ſcabbineſs <hi>Pruritum veſicalem,</hi> a bliſtery or powky itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Grecian Leproſie <hi>Pruritum ſquamoſum,</hi> a ſcaly itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of this Leproſie are theſe: the skin is dry, rough, and full of ſmall knobs, which itch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and ſend out bodies like to the ſcales of Fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of it are either the external efficient cauſes, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal material.</p>
                     <p>The external efficient, are, 1. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Meats and Drinks.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Slovenlineſs, Sluttiſhneſs, and Filthineſs. <hi>Villanovanus</hi> the Poetical Phyſician hath compriſed theſe two cauſes learnedly in two Hexameter verſes, thus;</p>
                     <q>Illotus ſudor, &amp; inopia nobilis eſcae Saepe gravi ſcabie correptes aſperat artus.</q>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52816:92"/>
                     <p>Sweat not waſhed away, and want of good food often do make rough the limbs being taken with noiſome ſcabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The menſtrual courſes, or Hemorrhoids, which were wont to flow, being ſuppreſſed, may cauſe this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fontanels, which have long been kept open, being ſhut up, may procure the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Varices,</hi> the Veins tumefied by reaſon of melancholick Blood, being cured, ſometimes are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this grief.</p>
                     <p>The material cauſes are diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the colour of the grief: for if the knobs be of a livid or lead colour, ſuperfluous impure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is the cauſe; if they be white, or of a greyiſh colour, then ſalt Phlegm is predominant, which is mingled with Melancholy: and becauſe aged perſons multiply ſalt Phlegm, they are often troubled with this grief.</p>
                     <p>As for the preſages, let this be the firſt: this grief, if it be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and of a long continuance, it is not eaſily cured.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if it be neglected, it may turn to the Leproſie of the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſcabbineſs is more contagious than this grief; for it is more ſuperficial, and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion is more readily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, if any lying with a perſon infected lay his skin to the others.</p>
                     <p>This Grief is cured by a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Diet, purgation of the Body, and local means. The Diet muſt be cooling and moiſtning, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a laudable juice, whereof I have ſpoken ſufficiently before in ſeveral Chapters.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52816:92"/>and the Greek Leproſie.</p>
                     <p>Now I will proceed to the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian <hi>Lepra;</hi> with the which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is troubled, he is called a Lazarous perſon.</p>
                     <p>This grief is called by the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians <hi>Elaphantiaſis,</hi> and that for three cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the skin is deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rough wrinkles; yea the chinks being ſometimes deep, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like furrows in a Hide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the skin of an Elephant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe if it poſſeſs the Legs, it makes the Leprous perſon go ſtiffe, as an Elephant doth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe as an Elephant of all Beaſts is the mightieſt; ſo this grief is moſt rebellious: ſo that it was called <hi>Leontiaſis</hi> according to <hi>Aëtius,</hi> becauſe it is invincible as a Lion; and becauſe the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is wrinkled like to a Lions.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo called <hi>Satyriaſis,</hi> and that for two cauſes: Firſt, becauſe Leprous perſons Faces repreſent in Figure the Faces of the Satyrs, as they are deſcribed by Poets: for their Lips are thick, their Noſe ſwells; wherefore in the ridge it ſeems low, their Cheeks ſeem red, and the Tumors in the Forehead look like horns, all which expreſs the Face of a Satyr, feigned by the Poets.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe the perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected are very lecherous, as the Poets feign the Satyrs to be: See <hi>Galen. lib. de cauſ. morb. cap.</hi> 7. In the Introductory Book aſcribed to <hi>Galen</hi> it is ſaid, that it was called <hi>Dracontiaſis,</hi> becauſe as the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is ſaid to be the worſt of all Serpents, ſo this Diſeaſe is ſaid to be the worſt of all other griefs. Amongſt us Chriſtians it is called the grief of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the cauſes of the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, I will divide them into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal efficient, and the internal material cauſe.</p>
                     <p>To the external efficient, I refer the continual uſe of Aliments apt to breed <hi>atra bilis;</hi> and for this cauſe the Germans have many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarous perſons, and Habitations appointed for them: for thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole year they eat Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage ſalted, much Cheeſe, old But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Fleſh dryed in the Smoak, but moſt of all Bacon. In like manner it is familiar to <hi>Aegypt:</hi> becauſe there they eat much Aſſes fleſh, and drink ſtanding and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Waters, if you except thoſe who inhabit places near to <hi>Nilus. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before the time of <hi>Pompey</hi> it was not ſeen in <hi>Italy,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Plin. nat. hiſt. l.</hi> 26. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Leproſie may be taken by having carnal copulation with an infected perſon, ſee <hi>Gordon. l. med. particul.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>Philippus Schopſius</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Leproſie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Arabians, <hi>Avicen, Albucaſis,</hi> and <hi>Averroes,</hi> think that if a Woman conceive while her Courſes flow, the Child will prove Leprous, but it is not likely: for that Blood in ſound Women is good, and after Conception it is retained to nouriſh the Child: ſo that if that Blood were venemous (as ſome think) no Man or Woman could be ſound. Fourthly, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe being often hereditary; it is propagated from the Parents to their Children.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, continual converſation with Leprous perſons cannot be but very dangerous; for if one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Pthiſical by often receiving the breath of one who is troubled with that grief, according to Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Authors, much more may one be infected by receiving the Air, infected with the breath of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous perſon, which is moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſtinking: wherefore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarous perſons in every well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered place dwell by themſelves, that they infect not others; and ſo God himſelf commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.4. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                     <p>The internal material cauſe by all is concluded to be <hi>Bilis atra.</hi> Now ſeeing this Humor is cauſed of three ſeveral Humors altered from their natural qualities, three ſorts of Leproſie do ſpring.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is cauſed of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Melancholick juice burned; this Leproſie cauſes the skin to be of a ruddy black colour. This kind of Leproſie comes on but ſlowly, and has milder ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
                     <p>The Second is of yellow vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telline choler aduſt: This ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily corrupts the inner parts, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Liver and Spleen, and from thence paſſing furiouſly to the habit of the Body, produces hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſymptomes: in this kind of Leproſie the Skin is o. a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour tending to Green.</p>
                     <p>The Third is cauſed of ſalt or nitrous Phlegm burned: In this, the colour is a paliſh white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the Leproſie which is cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Humor, is not ſo flerce as the former. There be two other differences taken from the progreſſion of the Diſeaſe: for a Leproſie is either in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or conſummate.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Leproſie begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are theſe: The Face ſeems to be of a livid reddiſh colour, the breathing is with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the voice ſeems to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hoarſe, livid ſpots appear in ſundry parts of the Body, the Skin begins to loſe its exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite feeling, the Urine is muddy and thick. <hi>Plinie</hi> affirms, that it was not ſeen in <hi>Rome</hi> before the time of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and began firſt in the Noſtrils, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bigneſs of a lentil, and from thence paſſed to the whole
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52816:93"/>body, producing ſpots of divers colours, making the skin unequal, and raiſing ſcurfs, and hard ſcabs.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a confirmed Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie are theſe: 1. The Skin loſes altogether its feeling, ſo that you may thruſt a needle thorow it, without any offence to the diſeaſed party; this happens becauſe the Humor, by reaſon of its thickneſs, ſtops the Nerves, and ſo hinders the animal ſpirits from paſſage. Nevertheleſs, the Muſcles move, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſluggiſhly; becauſe they have Veins and Arteries, by whoſe Blood and Spirits they are fed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Knobs appear in ſundry parts of the Body, but chiefly in the Face, about the Forehead; the Ears become thin, the Noſe flat upward, the Lips thick.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Face is of a leaden red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The voice becomes very hoarſe, the Lungs and Windpipe being affected.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Eyes become round, the thickneſs of the Humor bearing in the corners.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When the grief is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Warts very often do appear thorowout the whole body, like to hailſtones, as we ſee in meaſly Hogs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> affirms, that the powder of Lead calcined, will ſwim in the Urine of Leprous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſink in the Urine of all others.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They are troubled with much belching.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Their Sweat and Breath is moſt ſtinking, their breathing is with difficulty and ſtinking. by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſtriction of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Hair of the Head begins to fall, that of the Beard to grow thinner, and thoſe of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows and Eye-lids to fall alſo: this falls out, becauſe corrupt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſent to the Hair; for if you pull out a few of their Hairs, you ſhall alſo pull out with the roots a fleſhy ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Noſtrils without are tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefied, but within they are narrow, and ulcerate.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Veins under the Tongue ſeem varicous, ſmall knobs alſo like to hail-ſtones appear there.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The skin is unctuous, and will not admit water.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The skin is full of wrinkles and chops; as an Elephants skin is.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Muſcles of the Thumb waſt.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. If the Body, the Fingers, and Toes have ſtinking Ulcers, and Chops, you need not much to doubt.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. If you open a Vein, it will be thick, burned, ſeculent, and have as it were fat upon the top, and it being ſtrained thorow a cloth, leaves a greety ſubſtance behind it.</p>
                     <p>Now it is time to addreſs my ſelf to the Prognoſticks, whereof this ſhall be the firſt: A Leproſie in the very beginning is hardly cured; for the material cauſe of it is <hi>Atra bilis:</hi> now all diſeaſes of <hi>Bilis atra</hi> are hard to cure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Leproſie conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is altogether incurable by Art.</p>
                     <p>Now the means of curing a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie beginning, are three: Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetical, Pharmaceutical, and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diet, that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for a cancerous Tumor and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52816:94"/>Ulcer, in the former Chapter, in this Grief is alſo effectual. It is fit that leprous Perſons eat of the biggeſt Snails dreſſed, as Wilks, or Perwinkles, and Frogs, and that for a Month together; for this food doth exceedingly contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Heat of the Blood: the Water alſo diſtilled off them is good to be drunk: <hi>Rodericus Fonſeca</hi> commends this Drink: ℞ <hi>Rad.

                     <p>The Pharmaceutical means are of two ſorts: for either they are Cathartic, or Specific.

                     <p>As for the Specifical means, theſe are commended; the Decoctions of the Elm, <hi>Larix</hi>-tree, the Roots of Tamarisk, Ceterach, Fumiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Juniper-berries, boiled as <hi>Guajacum</hi> is, and drunk for a long time; ℥ iij. of Strawberry water or of <hi>Cuſcuta,</hi> Dodder, taken Morning and Evening. <hi>Crolli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If the proud Fleſh be grown to that height, that it will not ſtoop to Deſiccatives, then you are to have recourſe to thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, that are called <hi>Cathaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica; Auferentia,</hi> which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuperfluous fungous Fleſh. Theſe are not ſo hot as either eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carotical, or ſeptick Medicaments, and thoſe which bliſter: yet hot they are, and burn, tho gently: being then hot and dry in the fourth Degree, they are of a thick and aſtringent ſubſtance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Medicaments pierce not deep, partly by reaſon of their thick Subſtance, partly by reaſon of their rebated Heat; wherefore theſe only ſuperficially dry and corrode the Fleſh. Neither do they cauſe any great pain, becauſe their Heat is not very intenſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be graduate by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of ſome other things.

                     <p>Two Catheretical Unguents are much uſed, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum,</hi> and <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Of theſe two, <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> is the ſtrongeſt: In plain Ulcers I would not adviſe you to uſe it, for it ſpreads, and by touching the ſound part cauſes great pain. It is effectual in fretting ſores of the Mouth and ſinuous Ulcers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved either in decoctions, or diſtilled waters convenient for the kind of ſores.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Apoſtolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> if it be made according to Art, it is a Catheretical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in tender Bodies; but only a Mundificative in thoſe who have a firm and ſolid conſtitution of Body.</p>
                     <p>It falls out many times, that the ſuperſluous Fleſh is ſo hard and compact, that it contemns all Catheretical Medicaments, and cannot be abated by them. In this courſe we are to have recourſe to thoſe Medicaments which are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Putrefacientia,</hi> or rotting the part; and to thoſe which are not named <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>Cruſtam inducentia,</hi> which leave an Eſchar or Cruſt after they are applied.</p>
                     <p>As for Eſcharotical Medicaments which are called <hi>Exedentia,</hi> or eating Medicines, ſeeing they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the natural Heat, they muſt be hot above the third Degree, and have a thick, viſcous, and terreſtrial Subſtance, the Heat is to be durable and permanent. And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52816:96"/>we ſee that Pepper, Onions, and ſuch like, tho they be hot above the third Degree, yet they are not cauſtick; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although they inflame, yet becauſe their Heat is placed in a thin and ſubtil Subſtance, it is more eaſily diſſolved, and at laſt overcome by the natural Heat of our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>So, when Cauſticks are applied, notable pain is cauſed: Firſt, by reaſon of their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and exceeding great heat.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe by reaſon of their Terreſtrial Subſtance, they are long in piercing thorow the part.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe ſame Medicaments two are moſt uſed: the <hi>Lapis infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> and the white Cauſtick. I mean not to trouble you with the ſetting down of their preparations, becauſe they are ſufficiently known unto all who have profited any thing in the ſtudy and practice of Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe two the <hi>Lapis infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> is moſt effectual, and works moſt ſpeedily; wherefore it is moſt fit for making of Fontanels, where it may be conveniently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the upper part of the Member, and be hindred from ſpreading: but if a Cauſtick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament be to be applied to a depending part, and when there is fear of running, then the white Cauſtick is moſt convenient. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe two, two other Eſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotical Medicaments I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is Mercury ſublimate, mingled with Roman Vitriol cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, until it become red, and the true <hi>Terra ſigillata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond, <hi>Turbith</hi> Mineral mingled with theſe ſame; but whilſt it is white and not waſhed. Theſe do work more gently, if they be mingled with any Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or anodyne Unguent, than when they are applied to any Sore without mixture. But <hi>Turbith</hi> Mineral far exceeds Mercury ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate, becauſe it is more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Nature, and doth not cauſe ſuch pain; beſides, it is not ſo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil and piercing as the ſublimate is, which in tender Bodies aſſaulting the Heart it ſelf, doth cauſe ſharp Djaries, although they be but Symptomatical.</p>
                     <p>For the ſuppreſſing of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous excreſcent fleſh in Ulcers, the ſecond means I appointed, were called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Putrefacientia,</hi> corrupting Medicaments. Theſe are not ſo hot as thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which procure an Eſchar, or Cruſt, they have a more thin ſubſtance, and ſubtil, and hare not ſo much Terreſtreity, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction. Theſe do more eaſily pierce, and ſo cauſe not ſo great pain: the pain which theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments cauſe is pungitive, as if needles did prick being red hot, and it quickly ceaſes. And as cauſtick Medicaments leave the part corrupted in manner of a Cruſt, ſo theſe leave that which they corrupt, ſoft, moiſt, and of a blackiſh colour. If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Medicaments moiſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch a faculty, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Oyl of Vitriol, the Oyl of Sulphur, <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis.</hi> But if you will have ſolid and hard Medicaments, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As for the Septick Vegetables, becauſe they rather mortifie the inward parts, if they be ignorantly or maliciouſly miniſtred, than abate proud Fleſh in Ulcers, as <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opteris,</hi> the Fern of the Oak, and <hi>Aconitum</hi> or Leopardsbane, and ſuch like, I will leave them to the conſideration of villainous Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>But having only made mention of abating of ſuperfluous Fleſh in Ulcers, by the Application of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Medicaments, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me whether this may not be effected by Chirurgical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as actual Cauteries, and Inciſion Knives and Razors? Truly hitherto I have deferred the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kind of curing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God of his bounty in theſe later times hath in all faculties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed many things which were kept from our Forefathers. If a Patient reſolute offer himſelf to a skilful Chirurgeon to be cured, let the Chirurgeon, in Gods name, in extremities uſe Iron and Steel: yet let me adviſe him not to be too forward in three Caſes. 1. If the party be of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſtitution, and unwilling: for if a Chirurgeon do altogether urge theſe extremities, he may loſe his Patient, who is prompt to hearken to the Syrenian ſpeeches of deluding Knaves and Queans. 2. If you cannot handſomely come to the part, as if the Ulcer be ſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 3. If the ſuperfluous Fleſh require not only abating, but dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, it being marvellous moiſt, then a Medicament is better than the Inſtrument, becauſe it dries more powerfully:</p>

                        <p>Of Scaling corrupt Bones.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving in the laſt Chapter ſet down the Fountains from whence all the Accidents of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do ſpring, and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the manner of curing an Ulcer, wherein there is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence of ſuperfluous Fleſh, which was ſet down to be the prime Accident flowing from things according to Nature, I muſt be carried to the ſecond Accident, proceeding from things according to Nature, which is the Carioſity of the Bone.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing the Bones are the ſtays and props of the Body, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed not only for local Motion; but for the parts alſo which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Action, as Muſcles, Veins, Nerves, Arteries, I am with the greater care to ſet down the Cure of an Ulcer with the Carioſity of a Bone, ſeeing ſo many things of importance do depend upon the Cure of ſuch an Ulcer. In run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over the whole courſe of Chirurgery, I have reſolved upon this firſt Trial, to ſet down on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the general Practices, which they who are judicious may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to all Perſons and parts in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. In handling of this Accident, I will ſet down theſe four Points. 1. The Cauſes which procure the Carioſity of the Bones. 2. The Signs of a corrupt Bone. 3. The Prognoſticks of an Ulcer, wherein there is a Carioſity of the Bone: And 4. Of the means which are to be uſed for removing of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the corruption of the Bones, are either external, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes are two, to wit, too great Cold, and too great Heat: for as too great Cold quenches the natural Heat of the Bone; ſo immoderate Heat, by diſcuſſing the natural Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, dries and corrupts the Bones.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes which moſt frequently produce this Accident, are in number three. The firſt is a glutinous and ſuperfluous Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, firſt ſoſtning, and then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Bone, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſes a diſtortion of the Member, and a protuberance of the Bone, which I have ſundry times ſeen, and have noted not to have proceeded from any Venereal Cauſe. Such an Humor ſeiſed upon one, whoſe name was <hi>James Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon,</hi> who dwelt near to me, when I practiſed in the City of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52816:97"/>
                        <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and cauſed a bending out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of both the Shin-bones, or <hi>Oſſa tibiae:</hi> this happened to him when he was above ſixty years old: neither did this Accident either cauſe Nocturnal or Diurnal pain, or hinder his going. Before this did beſal him, he had a great eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of Blood (by reaſon of the Rupture of a Veſſel in his left Kidney) together with his Urine, of the which I cured him by the Decoction of ſome of the Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balans.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond inward Cauſe of the Carioſity of the Bones, is a ſharp and Malign Matter, which by touching corrupts the Bone: this happens moſt commonly in old and inveterate Ulcers: the <hi>Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteum</hi> being once eroded by the Acrimony of the <hi>Sanies,</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently corrupts the Bone. It is no marvel that a ſharp Humor is able to corrupt Bones, in other parts of the Body, when we ſee the Teeth to be hollowed by a ſharp Rheum, which a File of tempered Steel doth with ſome difficulty raſe.</p>
                     <p>The third inward Cauſe is an hidden and ſtrange quality of the Humor, adverſe to the Bones, ſeiſing not only upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bones, but upon ſome parts alſo of theſe Bones: for if it did with any manifeſt quality corrupt the Bones, it would firſt have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded the Fleſh: this being moſt ſubject to the impreſſion of any ſretting Humor. But the Bones very often are found to be carious, when the parts covering the Bones, as the <hi>Cuticula cutis,</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana carnoſa</hi> are found whole. So when Nodes invade the Citizens of <hi>Naples,</hi> they appear moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> or in the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> or <hi>Tibia,</hi> and that between the Joynts: Who is able to give a demonſtrative Reaſon of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion? He undoubtedly, who is able to ſhew, why the Loadſtone draws Iron, and Amber and Jet Chaff.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns diſcovering the Cario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Bone, are either Senſual, or Intellectual.</p>
                     <p>The Senſual are in number Five.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is, if the Bone appear black and fretted: Blackneſs is cauſed by the corruption of the natural Temperature, by which it is kept always white with a ruddy glimps, or of an Horſe-fleſh colour almoſt. Carioſity is cauſed by the Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Humor, fretting the ſubſtance of the Bone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is, when the Bone, being felt with a Probe, doth not appear ſmooth, but rugged.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is, if the Probe ſlip not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided into the Bone, for then the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> muſt be gone, and ſo the Bone either more or leſs corrupted, partly by reaſon of the Air, partly by reaſon of the Quittour ſettling upon the Bone.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is, if the Fleſh ulcerate above the Bone appear ſoft and ſpongy, or of a livid colour, it is to be doubted that the Bone is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for when the Bone is carious, the Fleſh is made ſoft and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo that any one may thruſt a Probe thorow it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great annoyance to the party.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Is this: If a Tent or Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get reaching to the Bone ſtink
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52816:98"/>the next day when it is taken out, there is juſt occaſion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuſpect that the Bone is carious.</p>
                     <p>The Intellectual Signs are in number Four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is, if more Quittour flow, from the Ulcer, than the bigneſs of it ſeems to afford.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is, if thin and ſtinking <hi>Sanies</hi> flow from the Sore, it is probable that the Bone is foul.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If an Ulcer admit skinning, and often break out again, it may not without cauſe be doubted that the Bone is foul: for an Humor ſtill flowing from the corrupt Bone cauſes a new inflammation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Skin is broken a new.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is this; If an Ulcer hath continued a long time, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious to proper Medicaments, it may be thought that the Bone is carious, being much moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo made ſoft by the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: and therefore muſt be ſcaled.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of ſuch Ulcers as are accompanied with Carioſity of the Bone, receive theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No Ulcer accompanied with Carioſity of the Bone is of eaſie Cure: for it has a Mallgnity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Solution of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If there happen a Carioſity paſſing the firſt Table in either of the Bones above the Eye-brows, it will be an hand matter to cicatrize it. If this be a true Aphoriſm in Wounds dividing theſe parts, how much more true in Ulcers; thoſe only cauſing a Solution of Unity by an external Cauſe; but theſe eroding the parts by an inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Humor, which for the moſt part is ſtill ſupplied by ſome notable Diſtemperature of ſome noble part?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Shall be this; If any of the <hi>Vertebra</hi>'s of the <hi>Spina</hi> prove foul, ſhun the Cure: for firſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they will hardly ſcape: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is an hard matter to come to apply a Medicament unto them, by reaſon of the Muſcles placed above them. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a hard matter to ſhun the pairs of Nerves, which ſpring from the tranverſe Proceſſes of them.</p>
                     <p>Let this be Fourth; If in Ulcers of the Breaſt, the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Ribs be foul, be not too forward to meddle with them; for the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Quittour may eaſily corrode and pierce thorow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Muſcles and the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and ſo lay open to the Air the Vital Parts, which ere it be long muſt cauſe an extinction of the natural Heat, and ſo death it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth ſhall be this; Ulcers in the great Joynts, as the Elbows, Knees or Ankles, wherein there is Carioſity of the Bones, with loſs of the Cartilages, are for the moſt part uncurable, becauſe the pain in the Joynts is great, depriving the diſeaſed perſons of their natural reſt and ſleep, and ſo of good digeſtion and concoction of their Food: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they ſeldom fall out alone, but bring with them a <hi>Maraſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Dilatation; or enlarging of a narrow Sore, by ſtretching out the Circumference of it, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſuch things as ſwell, when they have imbibed any Moiſture, as the Roots of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Pith of Elder, and Sponges brought cloſe together, either by Thread, or Melilot Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are fit to be uſed in Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which poſſeſs the back of the Hand, or the inſtep of the Foot. The Bone being by ſome of theſe means laid bare, I am to ſhew you how the Bone is to be ſcaled.</p>
                     <p>This is to be performed three manner of ways, to wit, by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, Inſtruments, or an actual Cautery.</p>
                     <p>The Medicaments which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Scaling of a Bone, ought to be very drying, and of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and thin ſubſtance: for the ſound Bone, being aſſiſted and ſtrengthned by ſuch drying Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, ſends forth of its ſelf Fleſh, which being increaſed, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the corrupt Bone from the ſound.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Deſquamatory Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of three degrees.</p>
                     <p>For ſome are mild, as the Root of <hi>Peucedanum</hi> or Sow-fennel, <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda,</hi> the Root of <hi>Iris</hi> and Myrrh: theſe will ſerve if the Carioſity of the Bone be but Superſicial, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Party ſoft and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable.</p>
                     <p>Some again are yet more drying and ſtrong, as that Medicament of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> which is compoſed of equal parts of <hi>Ariſtolochia rotunda, Iris,</hi> Myrrh, <hi>Aloe,</hi> the rind of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52816:99"/>Plant <hi>Opopanax,</hi> whereout the Gumm iſſueth, the Pumice-ſtone calcined, the refuſe of Braſs melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Bark of the Pine-tree. All theſe being beat to powder may be applied alone, or mingled with Honey. Of this Nature alſo are <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and the root of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contium</hi> or Dragons. <hi>Fallopius</hi> has two Medicaments to this purpoſe: the firſt is this, ℞ <hi>Rad. Peuceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Iridis, an.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>Euphorb.</hi> ℈ j. <hi>fiat ex omnibus pulvis, qui exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatur paſtâ panis molli, atque oſſi corrupto applicetur.</hi> The Second is this, ℞ <hi>Rad. Peucedan. Ariſtol. rotund. Opopanac. Euphorb, an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. <hi>Terebinthinae</hi> ℥ j. <hi>Cerae</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>Aceti</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>fiat cerat. ex p. a.</hi> Theſe and ſuch Medicaments are to be uſed, when the carioſity is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what deep and the party of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able firm conſtitution of Body.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſome are ſtrongeſt of all, as <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> beat to powder, <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> having the tincture of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> the Oil of Cloves, or <hi>Petroleum</hi> wherein ſome Camphore is diſſolved, <hi>Aqua-fortis, Aqua regis,</hi> Oil of Sulphur, and Oil of Vitriol, and Roman Vitriol calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Theſe are to be uſed when the carioſity is deep, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the diſeaſed party ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and ſtrong. When theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are applied, the fleſhy parts adjacent muſt be very well defended, otherwiſe pain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation will be cauſed. If the Sores be well dreſſed, and theſe Medicaments judiciouſly applied, the Bones will ſcale within the ſpace of Forty daies.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the carioſity of the Bone is very deep, ſo that a long time will be required for the ſcaling of it: wherefore in this caſe we muſt have recourſe to inſtruments: the chief of theſe inſtruments are the Mallet and Chiſſels, and Raſpato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Firſt then, the corrupt part of the Bone is to be knocked off with the Mallet and Chiſſel until you come to the ſound Bone; which you ſhall know, if the Bone bleed, and appear white and firm, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Celſus.</hi> Secondly, the Bone is to be made even with the Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patories, and ſmoothed. In this caſe a Leaden Mallet is beſt: for it is weighty, and cauſes a leſſer noiſe: this being done, ſome of the aforenamed Medicaments muſt be applied according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the party; for by it you muſt be led.</p>
                     <p>In Ulcers of the Head it often falls out, that both tables of the Scull are foul, ſo that you ſhall be forced to remove a great piece of the <hi>Cranium:</hi> here you muſt uſe the Trepan and Headſaw, the uſe whereof ſhall be delivered, when I ſhall ſet down the Cure of the wounds of the Head.</p>
                     <p>The Third way to ſcale Bones, I named to be the actual Cautery: of it I will ſet down three docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The Firſt ſhall be, when it is to be applied? The Second ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> direct, where it ſhall be applied? The Third ſhall teach, how the Sore is to be dreſſed after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication?</p>
                     <p>As for the Firſt: it is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied when ſuperfluous Humidity flows to the Bone; this we may conjecture; Firſt, by the moiſt and cold conſtitution of the body of the perſon affected: the ſigns of ſuch a conſtitution I delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, when I diſcourſed of a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52816:99"/>wateriſh Tumor: whither I remit you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if after the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deſquamatory Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Bone ſtill appear moiſt and ſoft, not changing its colour.</p>
                     <p>The Second document ſhall be, where it is to be applied? You may apply it ſafety to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> laid bare.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you may uſe the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery in thoſe places, where dilatation only is permitted, and not inciſion, or potential Cautery, as in the back of the Hand, and inſtep of the Foot: but this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you muſt do thorow a pipe of White Iron, to ſave the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts from burning.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you may apply the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery to the Joints: if the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages be foul, and way be made. This practice <hi>Ambroſe Parey</hi> uſed when he had diſmembred one in the joynt of the Elbow: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred party found great eaſe and comfort by the application of it: See the Hiſtory, <hi>Lib. xi. cap. xxv.</hi> What forms of Cauteries you are to uſe, the ſigure of the Ulcer will ſhew you. When the actual Cautery is applyed, you are to be acquainted with the manner of dreſſing of the Bone, which was the third document.</p>
                     <p>How this is to be done <hi>Guido à Cauliaco</hi> ſhall teach you in his own words:
<q>I (quoth he) after the application of the Cautery, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for the ſpace of three daies Oil of Roſes tempered with the white of an Egg, and for three other, it mingled with the yolk of an egg; and afterward Butter with <hi>Mel roſatum,</hi> and ever above theſe applications ſome mundificative, until the bone ſcale. Afterwards, I incarnate and conſolidate the part with <hi>Avicen</hi>'s Medicament, which I delivered unto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Medicaments exfolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſecond degree.</q> 
                        <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> counſelleth after cauterizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uſe Pledgets moiſtned in Roſewater and the white of an Egg, to hinder inflammation for ſome few dreſſings: then to apply to the Bone Medicaments exfolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Beware of the uſe of an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery, if the Scull, or any of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back be foul, by reaſon of the Brain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt, and the <hi>Spinalis medulla</hi> contained in the ſecond; which being inflamed by the heat of the actual Cautery, will bring alienation of Mind, and Convulſions.</p>

                        <p>Of a diſcoloured and varicous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE two laſt differences of Ulcers taken from things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, were ſaid to be an Ulcer, wherein the natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is altered; and an Ulcer vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous. Firſt then I will diſcourſe of the Ulcer, wherein the colour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and then of an Ulcer varicous.</p>
                     <p>As for an Ulcer having the skin adjacent, and the ſubſtance of the part altered; The unnatural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which poſſeſs the part alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are moſt commonly four; red, yellow, livid, and black.</p>
                     <p>The red colour proceeds always from heat, cauſing an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The external efficient cauſes of it are ſuperfluous hot garments, too thick boulſters, rowlers made of Wooll, or of hard and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born linnen Cloth, the hot ſeaſon of the year, too ſtrait ligature, the uſe of hot Meats and Drinks, ſurfeting, venery troubling the maſſe of Blood, extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part, perſpiration hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by reaſon of the ſuffocation of the part, or incunneation of the Humor, and ſolemn evacuations ſuppreſſed, as of the flowing of Blood from the hemorrhoidal Veins in Men, or the menſtruous Blood from the veins of the <hi>Matrix</hi> in Women, by the error of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, applying things actually and potentially cold.</p>
                     <p>The material cauſe of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is Blood offending: Now the Blood may offend two manner of ways, to wit, in quality, if it be too hot or fervid; or in quantity, if the Body be plethorick. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving then this red colour, one of the ſymptomes of Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our firſt care muſt be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the external efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

But ſeeing theſe things are at large ſet down by thoſe who have written of the Practice of Phyſick, I have only pointed at the beſt Indications, which ſerve for the curing of theſe griefs, and the rather becauſe the ſpeculation of them doth belong to another Faculty and Art, to wit, Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>If the material cauſe of this ſymptome, which is Blood, offend in quality, being too hot, then it is to be cooled by a refrigerating Diet, which I at large ſet down, when I diſcourſed of a Phlegmon, to which place I remit you. If in quantity it offend, firſt Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or opening of a Vein is to be uſed, and Blood drawn, as the age, conſtitution of the party, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the grief ſhall require. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the part it ſelf is to be ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and either Ventoſes or Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be applied, that the Blood may iſſue out plentifully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the part.</p>
                     <p>A livid, or leaden colour in an Ulcer follows: Two cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a livid colour in Ulcers: the Firſt is black Blood impacted in the part: The Second is external cold, or defect of the natural heat.</p>
                     <p>This livid colour doth happen moſt frequently by reaſon of black and corrupt Blood ſetled in the part: for as a bright red colour under white, cauſeth a lively blue, or azure colour, as we may ſee in the Veins of ſound and healthful perſons; ſo black under white cauſeth a livid, or a leaden colour. This accident is to be removed by ſcarification, and application of Cupping-glaſſes, Horns, or Leeches. Afterward the ſcarifications are to be fomented with <hi>Oxymel</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> water.</p>
                     <p>If the lividity proceed from cold: you ſhall perceive it by the cold
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52816:101"/>conſtitution and temperature of the part. In this caſe you are to apply ſuch local Medicaments as are able to reduce the natural Heat and Complexion. <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de tumoribus, c.</hi> 26. <hi>de Gangraena,</hi> affords a notable one, and a parable, which is this: Take an ordinary Turnep; and a Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh-root of reaſonable bigneſs, grate or ſcrape theſe two, and add to them of powder of Muſtard Seed ℥ j. of powder of Cloves <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. of Oyl of Lin-ſeed and Wall-nuts very old, ſo much as is ſufficient, and make a Poultice, which apply warm; he calls this Cataplaſm, <hi>Medicamentum optimum &amp; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> A moſt excellent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Medicament; with which he affirms himſelf to have cured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: ſo that you need not doubt of the efficacie and certainty of it: and the Ingredients ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe no leſs.</p>
                     <p>The laſt unnatural colour is a black colour: this may proceed either from Heat or Cold. If it hath proceeded from Heat, then an inflammation went before; if from Cold, then lividity did precede. The firſt betokens Aduſtion; but imperfect: ſo we ſee Wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be perfectly burned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinerate, or turned to aſhes, to become black. And in a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle the lower part is of a dark red, the middlemoſt black, and in the top thereof is a white Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule, the Heat beginning the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtion in the lowermoſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it in the middlemoſt, and perfecting the Aduſtion in the top: for it is the property of Fire to heat or mount up, and to be moſt effectual aloft. If before black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lividity did appear, it is to be feared, that the part begins to be mortified at the leaſt, if any feeling or heat remain: if theſe cannot be perceived, then you may boldly ſay, that a <hi>Sphace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This Particle <hi>[cauſing a Tumefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on].</hi> is added, to exclude Veins which are naturally big. <hi>Galen de method. medend. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 13. numbers this affection amongſt the Diſeaſes which proceed from the Quantity increaſed. It may be accounted a Diſeaſe, becauſe the Actions of the Parts which it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes are hindred; for if it poſſeſs the Legs, they become extenuate, and by reaſon of the heavineſs of the Humor, they become ſlow in motion. If this affection invades the Stones, the party becomes barren.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of it are either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or external. According to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the material Cauſe is Blood, being impregnate with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; he affirms it proceeds from Blood, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de hiſtor. animal. c.</hi> 19. where he notes, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not troubled with <hi>Varices;</hi> becauſe they turn out their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Blood by their natural Fluxes, and that they are leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Hemorrhoids in like manner. And the this doth prove true in moſt Women, yet there may be ſundry Women found, who both have <hi>Varices,</hi> and are ſubject to the Hemorrhoids.

                     <p>The antecedent Cauſes are in number Four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is a melancholick and pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous temperature: ſo they who have a bad Spleen, are moſt ſubject to this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An hairy and an hard habit of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Maſculine Sex: for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ſo frequently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this affection, becauſe monthly they diſcharge all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52816:102"/>Blood, if they be healthful: as hath been ſaid out of <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> 3. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal. c.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>Probl.</hi> 29.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Either ripe or old Age: for according to <hi>Hippoc. in Coac. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> they happen not before the fourteenth year of the Age, in the Legs; although even Children may have <hi>Varices</hi> in the Teſticles. Why Eunuchs are not troubled with <hi>Varices, Ariſt. Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>Problem.</hi> 29. yields a reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are deprived of Seed and Spirits. <hi>Avicen</hi> adds to theſe, ſharp Diſeaſes going before: for in theſe the thinneſt part of the Humors being ſpent by ſweat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible perſpiration, and diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on procured by Art; the thicker part being turned to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places, may procure <hi>Varices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Primitive Cauſes are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A thick and impure Air; becauſe it weakens the Legs, and makes them more apt to receive ſuperfluous Humors. And for this cauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, that men who dwell in the Weſtern part, are frequently troubled with this affection, and Ulcers in the Legs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Immoderate Exerciſe; ſo we may ſee Foot-men and Porters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to have <hi>Varices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Long ſtanding: according to <hi>Averr.</hi> 6. <hi>collect.</hi> 2. From hence <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſaith; <hi>Fiet varicoſus aru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpex:</hi> He ſhall become a varicous Sooth-ſayer: for they who took upon them to find out future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences by the flying of Birds, were enforced often to ſtand a long time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thick Wine and groſs Food: ſuch are old Fleſh ſalted, or ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Peaſe and Beans.</p>
                     <p>As for the Preſages, let this be the firſt:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If <hi>Varices</hi> appear in thoſe who are mad by reaſon of the melancholick Humor; the Grid ceaſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Varices</hi> mitigate Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſities, or bunching in any part of the Body: for the Humor which cauſes them, is by theſe means averted from maintaining of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Varices</hi> appearing either in the right or leſt Teſticle, help a ſqueaking Voice; the Humor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned from the Breaſt to the Teſticles, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in the fifth Section of his Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks. This may happen for two Cauſes. 1. By reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which is between the ſpiritual and genital Members. 2. Becauſe Baldneſs, Stutting, Liſping, and a Squeaking Voice, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the ſame Book, are melancholick affections.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p>The Chirurgical Cure of <hi>Varices</hi> is performed by two means, Uſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Exection; Uſtion is to be uſed when the <hi>Varix</hi> is ſtreight, and not much tumefied.</p>
                     <p>The manner of Uſtion is this: Inciſe the Skin until you come to the Vein, and ſeparate it from the parts adjacent; then ſhunning the brims of the Wound, cauterize the coat of the Vein; four inches from this Uſtion do the like, and ſo ſtill, until you come to the end of the <hi>Varix.</hi> This being done, dreſs theſe Uſtions as you uſe to dreſs parts burned.</p>
                     <p>Exciſion is to be uſed when the <hi>Varix</hi> is crooked, and hath wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, according to <hi>Celſus:</hi> but in my judgment a ſtreight <hi>Varix</hi> is better cured by Exciſion than that which hath windings and creeks,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52816:103"/>becauſe it is more eaſily ſeparated, and will admit a more beautiful <hi>Cicatrix:</hi> whereas in cutting the other there muſt be horrible pain, and an ugly <hi>Cicatrix</hi> muſt be left.</p>
                     <p>The manner of Exciſion is this: you are to begin at what end of the <hi>Varix</hi> you will, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Vein from the adjacent parts, until you come to the other end; then bind the Vein hard at each end, and cut off what remains between the two Ligatures: this being done, the brims of the Wound are to be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to be healed with glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinative Medicaments. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Marius</hi> writes, that he having this Grief in both his Legs, ſubmitted himſelf to this manner of Cure; and when he had put forth one, did conſtantly endure the Exciſion of the <hi>Varix</hi> in it, that no Man ſhould have doubted of his Valour; but when the Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon would have done the like in the other Leg, <hi>Marius</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flatly, that he meant not to buy Beauty with ſuch pain; it is not to be thought that any in this our tender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They are ingendred of putrid Humors, in unclean and ſordid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers negligently dreſſed, but moſt frequently in hollow, deep, and ſinuous Ulcers: for in ſuch the Quittour is longeſt lodged, and the putredinal Heat is greateſt. And for this cauſe they are ſeen in Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Ears, for the Quittour is there long detained by reaſon of the windings and labyrinths of the Ear</p>
                     <p>The material cauſe of theſe Maggots for the moſt part is a pituitous Excrement, as <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineta</hi> witneſſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p>The efficient cauſe is Heat, and that of two ſorts: The one is extraneous, and putrefactive, cauſing corruption of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                     <p>The other is Natural: ſeeing, according to the Philoſopher, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de generat. animal. cap.</hi> 2. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be produced of Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction only, unleſs Concoction put to its helping hand; then in a verminous one which is preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, there is Putrefaction, Heat and the Ulcer it ſelf, beſides Worms, the effects of the firſt two.</p>
                     <p>As for the Signs, they are three: The firſt is the ſenſe of Sight, for oftentimes they are ſeen, if either the cavity of the Ulcer be ample, or that they are voided with the Quittour.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the motion of them felt by the Patient: their motion is called <hi>Motus undeſus,</hi> like unto the waves of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52816:104"/>Sea, contracting and extending it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The third is a pinching pain now and then: for living they muſt be fed, and their feeding muſt of neceſſity cauſe more or leſs pain.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Sign is horrible ſtink, by reaſon of great putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>When you go about to cure ſuch an Ulcer, attempt not the taking out of the Maggots with any Inſtrument, for your labour will be fruitleſs, and the pain of the Patient great; and grant that you take many away with your Inſtrument, yet you muſt leave the putredinal Heat, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humor, for the breeding of more.</p>
                     <p>I wonder, that even great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors make mention of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the actual Cautery in this Caſe: they might be born withall, if theſe Ulcers were plain, and ſhallow; for ſo the ſuperfluous Humidity might be dried, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction removed: but they with an unanimous conſent confeſs, that theſe Maggots are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bred in ſinuous and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ulcers, (as hath been ſaid) and moſt frequently in the Summer time, and Southerly winds blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and ſo a great heat would be induced, and the Patient put to great pain, if they could reach to the cavity of the Ulcer, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Worms then muſt firſt be killed, and then they will iſſue out of the Ulcer without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe things which kill theſe Worms, do it either by a manifeſt, or hidden quality.</p>
                     <p>They which kill them by their manifeſt quality muſt be bitter, ſuch are Wormwood, Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Calamint, <hi>Aloe,</hi> Fern, Bulls gall, Meal of Lupines, Leaves of the Peach-tree, Capers, the Roots or the diſtilled Water of the Roots of Couch-graſs, called <hi>Gramen caninum,</hi> Horebound, <hi>Scordium,</hi> Mugwort, Centaury the leſſer, Mints.

                     <p>The efficient cauſe is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat of the Guts: for intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat rather burns the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, than produces any thing of them.</p>
                     <p>The material Cauſe, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted part of the Chyle ſent away to the ſmall Guts from the Stomach, and left undrawn by the meſaraical Veins. This part of the Chyle, being crude, and left in the Inteſtines, mixt with the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Humor, is elaborate by the temperate heat of the Guts; and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52816:105"/>the form, which lay hid in this Matter before, is brought forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by this heat; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diverſity of the latent forms, ſundry ſorts of Worms are bred. In the aforenamed Title of <hi>Schenkius,</hi> you may read of the ſtupendous figures of Worms, ſet down by learned and famous Men in their Monuments, who have ſeen them.</p>
                     <p>As for the differences of them: they are either ordinary, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Of the ordinary there are three ſorts: The Firſt is <hi>Teretes,</hi> the round ones, not unlike to Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms in Figure; but in colour different: for they are whitiſh.</p>
                     <p>The Second are called, <hi>Aſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> theſe are like unto Worms which grow in Cheeſes, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots in Fleſh: they are for the moſt part bred in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third kind is called <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricus latus,</hi> the broad Worm; and <hi>Taenia,</hi> which in <hi>Greek</hi> is called a Swadling-band, by reaſon of its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, for it is broad and long, and it has ſundry joynts. This Worm will be of a ſtrange length. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>nat. hiſtor. cap.</hi> 33. affirms, that ſome have been thirty foot in length. <hi>Conciliator diff.</hi> 101. ſaies, one voided ſuch a one fifteen Foot in length. <hi>Alexand.

I my ſelf when I was in the <hi>Newry,</hi> a Town in the North part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being deſired to viſit a young Man who had a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in <hi>Perinaeo,</hi> and whoſe Body was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly extenuate; when I had miniſtred a doſe of 2 gr. of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. vitae</hi> to him, he voided ſuch a Worm, tucked like a crabtree cudgel, about the thickneſs of a Childs finger, he kept it in a little pewter Baſin for my coming: when he was in voiding of it, he was in great fear, thinking that his Guts came out.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſigns of Worms; you ſhall know any one to be troubled with round Worms by theſe ſigns: the party finds gnawing and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain in the Belly, has gnaſhing of the Teeth, chiefly in ſleep; is troubled with a dry and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cough; the Noſtrils itch: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Children having them, are ſtill picking their Noſe; the Face is evil coloured, the Cheeks are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a red, ſometimes of a livid colour: the Eyes are hollow; the Mouth is wateriſh; the Breath is ſtrong; there is a deſire to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; the Hicket oftentimes; Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and heavineſs of the Head; Drowſineſs; Convulſions; ſtarting in the Sleep; ſtretching of the Belly: an extenuation of the reſt of the Body; horrible Dreams, looſeneſs of the Belly; ugly and ſtinking Excrements do fall out. This is holden for an experiment, if water be poured upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in the Morning, the party being faſting, he or ſhe ſhall find a drawing in of the Belly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſhrinking of the Worms, ſhunning cold. All theſe ſigns are not found in every perſon, but ſome in ſundry.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> or ſmall Worms be bred in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> a horrible itch troubles the party, and they are often ſeen in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:52816:105"/>
                     <p>If <hi>Taenia,</hi> or the long broad Worm be in the Guts, the party has an inſatiable appetite, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſumes, and ſome ſubſtance comes from it like to the ſeeds of a Cucumber. The falling Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs oftentimes proceeds from the round Worms, but ſeldom from the broad and the <hi>Aſcarides.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now come to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which the diverſity of Worms afford.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> if they be ſmall, they are of all ſorts leaſt dangerous, for they are fartheſt from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, and are moſt eaſily kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by Clyſters, or injections of bitter things; it is otherwiſe if they be big, for then they are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of a worſe matter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Taenia</hi> is of all others the worſt, becauſe it is biggeſt, and hardeſt to be killed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The bigger are worſe than the leſſer, and many more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than few, and the red are worſe than the white.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If in the beginning of ſharp di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes round worms come out alive, they betoken peſtilent diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is good if round Worms come out, even when the <hi>Criſis</hi> is at hand, or in the declination of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If in perſons not ſick, Worms come out either at the Mouth or Noſe, it betokens no harm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this they do for lack of food.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If this happen in ſick perſons, it is an ill ſign, for it argues the malignity of the Matter, which the worms labour to ſhun.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If Worms expelled, ſeem to be ſprinkled with Blood, it is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As for the Cure, it is performed by two Indications; the Firſt is by killing of them; the Second by expelling of them killed.</p>
                     <p>They are killed either by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Medicaments, or external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
                     <p>The internal Medicaments are either ſimple or compound; the ſimple are either Vegetables, or Minerals, or Animals.</p>

                     <p>The efficient cauſe of Lice, is the natural temperate heat, mixed and concurring with the heat pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactive.</p>
                     <p>The material cauſe, is the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third concoction, or aſſimilation, which are hot; but not ſharp or malign.

That you may the better underſtand this opinion, you muſt underſtand, that when Blood is turned to the nouriſhment of the parts, divers excrements are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; of which ſome are diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inſenſible Perſpiration, ſome by Sweat, ſome cleave without to the Skin, as the Morphew and the filth which cleave to the ſoles of the Feet, called <hi>Strigmenta;</hi> and ſcales in the Head and other parts: ſome ſtay within the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and theſe are either ſharp and of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign quality, and theſe cauſe ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Hair; or they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of both theſe qualities, and they produce Lice.</p>
                     <p>The diſſerences of theſe Lice are two: for ſome are moſt commonly without the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and ſome within the <hi>Cuticula;</hi> of thoſe that are without, ſome are familiar as the common ſort; ſome are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The moiſt are two, <hi>Achor</hi> and <hi>Favus.</hi> Theſe diſpoſitions of the Head are called by the <hi>Arabians, Sahafati,</hi> by <hi>Avicen.</hi> 7.4. <hi>tract.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Serap. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzoar, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tract.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. and they are nothing elſe but ſmall ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate Tumors of the whole skin of the Head, cauſed by ſharp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humors. All ſmall Tumors, in <hi>Latine, Tubercula,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians</hi> are called <hi>Bothor.</hi> So then as the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> or the ſcarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, is the ſeat of <hi>Pthiriaſis</hi> or the Louſie Malady, ſo the place of theſe griefs is the whole Skin, both the <hi>Cutioula,</hi> and the <hi>Cutis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The material cauſe is a ſharp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Humor.</p>
                     <p>Now ſharp Humors are of two ſorts: for ſome are ſharp of their own nature, as Choler: and ſome by accident. By accident, Humors may become ſharp two manner of ways. Firſt, by exuſtion and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, as <hi>Bilis atra,</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy not natural but excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious. Secondly, by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of a ſharp Humor. Theſe ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous Tumors of the Head may be cauſed not only of ſimple ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of their own nature, but alſo of Humors made ſharp by accident.</p>
                     <p>The Chymiſt will have a Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olick Salt to be the material cauſe of theſe Ulcers. See <hi>Joan. Faler. Chirurgiae Spagyricae, c. xv.

Favus <hi>is the like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; yet wherein the holes are larger, containing an Humor in thickneſs reſembling Honey, from whence it hath its name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The primitive cauſes are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber two: corrupt nouriſhment and contagion: of the firſt I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed heretofore; of the ſecond there is doubt to be made: for it may be daily ſeen, that theſe griefs are communicated by contact and frequent converſation.</p>
                     <p>The material cauſe is a ſharp and fretting Humor, viſcous in both theſe Ulcers, yet thinner in an <hi>Achor,</hi> than it is in that which is called <hi>Favus. Galen</hi> and <hi>Aegine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The cauſe conjunct is the ſame humor impacted in the skin of the Head.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of theſe two are theſe: Firſt, in both theſe Tumors there is an itching and a Tumor. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, holes appear in both, but in an <hi>Achor</hi> leſs, in a <hi>Favus</hi> greater.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52816:108"/>And although Lice are often ſeen in both; yet it is proper for <hi>Favus</hi> to have ſcales.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks receive theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Young perſons are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe griefs, and amongſt theſe Children moſt frequently: The cauſes of this may be two. Firſt, becauſe they may have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many impurities in the Mothers womb, which when they are come to the light, the natural heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, they labour to expel; or it may happen by reaſon of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Milk of the Nurſe, who uſeth an ill Diet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe Ulcers, if they have continued long, and have much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and corroded the Skin, when they are cured, they leave behind them baldneſs of the parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe griefs free Children from the Falling-ſickneſs, according to <hi>Hippocrates, Lib. de ſacro morbo, Avicen, lib.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>c. de Epilepſia.</hi> For the Humor which might cauſe this diſeaſe, is ſent from the inner to the outer parts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If theſe griefs be hereditary, they hardly can be cured: feeing this is true in all other Maladies, how much more certain, when to the Humor a malignity is joyned, as in theſe, as all muſt confeſs?</p>
                     <p>The means which are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the cure of theſe griefs are of two forts, Phyſical and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſical are three; A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient order of Diet, Phlebotomy and Purgation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diet, that is moſt fit which was ſet down in the Chapter delivered concerning the cure of the Leproſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> for by ſome this is accounted a particular Leproſie. All ſurfetting, ſtrong and ſweet Wines; ſharp, ſalt, and fried Meats are to be ſhunned; and ſuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a groſs impure juice, as hard Eggs, Fiſhes living in muddy waters: Purſlain, according to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venzoar,</hi> exceedingly furthers theſe griefs.</p>
                     <p>As for Phlebotomy, two Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may induce you to uſe this: Firſt, a <hi>Plethora</hi> of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Secondly, much corrupt Blood ſetled in the veſſels of the Head. If there be a fulneſs in the whole body, then it is fit to open the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of both the Arms: it matters not much at which you begin: Let ſome daies paſs between the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the one and the other. Let the ſtrength, age, time of the year, and the like circumſtances ſhew you what quantity of Blood is to be drawn. If much impure Blood be congeſted in the Head, open the <hi>Cephalica,</hi> the Veins under the Tongue, the <hi>Venafrontis,</hi> yea, and the Arteries of the Temples; for they powerfully derive corrupt Blood and foul Spirits from the Head.</p>
                     <p>As for Purgation: if this muſt be general, then no Medicament is better than <hi>Confectio Hamech,</hi> or <hi>Hiera Diacolocynthidos,</hi> with Syrup of Roſes ſolutive with Agarick in Betony, Eye-bright, Strawberry, Cowſlip, or water of Black Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

                     <p>The Chirurgical means are the artificial dreſſings of the Ulcers with local Medicaments.

                     <p>When you are to apply theſe Unguents, which was the Second point of the Chirurgical means: Firſt, you are to mark whether the roots of the Hairs be corrupt or no; for if the roots be corrupt, they muſt be pulled out: you ſhall know this by pulling out of a few, and obſerving the roots: for if the roots be thicker than ordinary, and moiſt, you may be aſſured that they are corrupt: they are to be pulled out in Children, that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apply your Topicks: In aged perſons, not only to this end, but to open the Skin alſo, and to make it more perſpirable, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humors may be the more eaſily corrected and ſpent.</p>
                     <p>The Hairs are readily pulled out, by application of an Emplaſter of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52816:109"/>red Wax new made, drawn upon Leather, and lying to the Ulcers twelve hours. Secondly, above the Unguents you are to apply Sparadraps made only of Wax, to ſave the Unguents, and keep them to the Sores without much waſte. Thirdly, you are to foment the Sores with red Wine, or Tanners wooſe, wherein Pomegranate Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Rinds, Myrtil-berries, and <hi>Sumach,</hi> with red Roſe-leaves dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been infuſed in a Pot ſet by the fire-ſide, before you uſe the Unguents.</p>
                     <p>If Children be offered to you to be cured, you muſt have a care that you uſe gentle Medicaments to them, and that their Caps be ſo tied to their Heads, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pull them off.

                        </gap>at in the Body of Man, being of it ſelf black, can produce ſuch a coloured Ulcer, to wit, white or yellowiſh.</p>
                     <p>The Primitive Cauſes are four; Error committed in the things not natural; Heredity; the corrupt Milk wherewith Children are fed; and Contagion and Infection.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are dry cruſty Scales, moſt commonly white, ſometimes yellowiſh, or of an aſh-colour, or greeniſh, never black altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>As for the Preſages: let this be the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Ulcer is hard to be cured, becauſe it is Malign and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Inveterate Ulcers of this kind are more Malign, and harder to be cured, than thoſe which have but lately invaded any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they are cured, they often leave behind them an <hi>Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecia</hi> or <hi>Ophiaſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sometimes they end in the Leproſie, and pedicular or louſie Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If in a <hi>Tinea</hi> the Skin be hard, or of a ſhelly ſubſtance, and ſend out many Scales, and the Hairs fall by reaſon of the corruption of the Roots of them, it is of all others moſt hard to be cured.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If this Ulcer being once cured, return, pronounce it to be hard to cure: for there muſt be ſome Seed of this malign Malady firmly impreſſed in the Brain.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of this Grief, two Indications offer themſelves: The firſt is the removing of the Cauſes; but ſeeing the Cauſes are Primitive or Conjunct: The Primitive Cauſes are removed, by rightly ordering thoſe things which are called <hi>Res non Naturales:</hi> The Cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct is taken away by Purgation and Phlebotomy. As for Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy and Purgation, although that may ſuffice which I have delivered in ſetting down the healing of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:52816:110"/>and <hi>Favus;</hi> yet let me inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate this unto you, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that once a quarter you open the <hi>Cephalica</hi> two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the full of the Moon, and that for Purgation you call Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Medicaments to aid, when Vegetables will not ſerve. <hi>Parcy</hi> is of opinion, that the means which are uſed in curing of the French Pox are effectual in curing this Grief: uſe theſe then, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius ſublimatus duleis, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith</hi> Mineral, Mercury precipitate dulcified, Mercury coagulate, and fixed by Gold and Silver.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Indication is the cure of the Ulcer it ſelf by local means.</p>
                     <p>But before you go about to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any local Medicaments, obſerve theſe paſſages: Firſt, that you meddle not with tender Children, if they have a malign <hi>Tinea,</hi> until they be able to abide ſharp Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for you ſhall vex both them and their Parents, and ſo ſhall procure a diſmiſſion to your ſelves. In the mean time you may uſe a Liniment made of the Oyl of Eggs, <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and calcined Harts-horn to the part, laying above it either a cap of Ivy-leaves or Colewort-leaves. Secondly, that you apply no repercuſſives to the Malady: for the Humor cauſing it, is ſo thick that it cannot be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The third is that unto new <hi>Tinea</hi>'s and mild, you apply mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but to thoſe which are old and malign, ſharper and fiercer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
                     <p>In the Application of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, three things are to be done: Firſt you are to procure the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Scale: Secondly, you are to pull out the Hairs by the roots: Thirdly, you are to hed the Ulcer, You ſhall procure the fall of the Scales, by embrocating them with a Medicament made of the Oyl of Trotters, and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilages of the Root of <hi>Althaea,</hi> Linſeed and Fenugreek, adding ſome Oyl of Arſenick or Mercury.

                     <p>The Internal Cauſe is a ſharp Humor ſent from the Brain to the cavity of the Ear, which firſt of all cauſeth Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, I healed, and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized it with my vulnerary Syrup diſſolved in Plantain-water.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch an Accident come to your hands, proceed thus metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, and you ſhall undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring to paſs that which you ſhall go about. So much I thought good to deliver unto you concerning the dignotion, and cure of the Ulcers of the Ears, which often prove troubleſome to the Patient and Chirurgeon, and loathſome to others, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the party grieved, by reaſon of the evil ſmell, which the Ulcer ſometimes ſends forth.</p>
                     <p>Now I will come to the Ulcers of the Eyes, which ought exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely to be handled, ſeeing the ſenſe of Sight, the Inſtrument whereof is the Eye, is ſo pleaſing and neceſſary to all Perſons. Of all the Ulcers of the Eye, <hi>Fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> or <hi>Aegylops,</hi> firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf; but ſeeing I amply diſcourſed of it, when I delivered the Doctrine of <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to that Chapter.</p>
                     <p>In this my Diſcourſe of the other
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52816:112"/>Ulcers of the Eyes I will firſt ſet down the general Doctrine of them, and then deſcend to the particular handling of each one of them.</p>
                     <p>In the general Doctrine, I will deliver three Things: to wit, their Cauſes: Secondly, the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks; And thirdly, the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of curing them.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes are either External, or Primitive, or Internal.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes are two; to wit, a Blow, or a Contuſion by reaſon of a Fall.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſes are ſharp and eroding Huniors.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks, let this be the firſt: Ulcers of the Eyes in Perſons of an ill habit of Body, ſeldom end without leaving ſome ſcar, or infirmity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For this Cauſe be wary what you promiſe; for bountiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes can hardly be called back; and the Patients, being for the moſt part careful of the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their parts, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly expect the performance of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Children, or diſordered Perſons, be preſented to you to be cured of Ulcers in the Eyes, ever pronounce that the Cure will prove difficult and hard.</p>
                     <p>The methodical general inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of curing theſe Griefs are in number four; Good order of Diet, Phſebotomy, Purgation, and the Application of a Seton or Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanel, for Revulſion and derivation.</p>
                     <p>Having diſpatched the three Points, which the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Ulcers contains, I am come to ſet down how each one of theſe Ulcers in particular is to be cured.</p>
                     <p>As for the differences of them, they are either mild, or Malign. The mild are either of the <hi>Adna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> or <hi>Coniunctiva,</hi> or <hi>Cornea,</hi> or <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There be two kinds of it: One properly ſo called, proceeding from inward Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The other proceeding from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes, which properly is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Again, <hi>Ophthalmia vera</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more mild, when only the <hi>Conjunctiva</hi> is inflamed, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when as the Eye-lid beſides, is red, turned up, and ſomewhat ulcerate.</p>

                     <p>The primitive cauſes are the heat of the Sun, pain of the Head, a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fever, Duſt, Smoak, great Cold binding the part, blows upon the Head, bluſtering Winds, Ebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Venery, and according to <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> Oil. It brings an <hi>Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> becauſe it cleaves faſt to the Tunicles, and ſo ſtops the Pores, and ſo the heat is kept in, and inflames the Eye.</p>

                        <hi>Hippocrat. lib. de aer. aquis &amp; lxis,</hi> writes, that they which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the South, and hot regions, are eaſily aſſaulted by ſuch diſeaſes, and eaſily cured: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they who dwell in the Northern parts are not ſo eaſily tainted with this grief, but are more hardly cured. <hi>Avicen</hi> yields the reaſons for this, ſaying, that they who dwell under a hot climate, have their Heads full of vapours and Humors, which being reſolved by the hot air, fall to the Eyes, and being there ſtaied, cauſe an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which afterward is eaſily cured. Firſt, becauſe their Bodies are more perſpirable. Secondly, becauſe they have ſtill a looſe Belly. But in cold regions, thô they have plenty of Humors in their Heads, yet they are congealed, and do not ſo promptly flow to the Eyes; but if they come to the Eyes, and be there impacted, they cannot ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be diſcuſſed, by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Skin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the Pores. So inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Eyes happen more frequently in the Summer to thoſe who have their Heads ſtuffed with Vapours and Humors, the heat colliquating them, and turning them to the Eyes.

                     <p>Signs of the Humors ſent are theſe: If Blood be it, the Eyes and Face will be red, the Veins will be full, the pain will be gravative, the matter that flows will not be very ſharp. If it be a vapour or flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, there will be a ſinging in the Ears, and a tenſive pain. If it be pituitous Blood, the Tumor will not be very red, but whitiſh, leſs heat and pain, great heavineſs of the Eyes and Eye-lids, the Eye-lids in the night time will be glued together.</p>
                     <p>This happens for three cauſes: Firſt, becauſe in the day-time the Eye is ſtill in motion, and ſuffers not the Humor to cleave to the Eye-lids.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe moiſture is multiplied in the night-time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the Humor concocts in the night-time, grows thick, and ſo is more apt to cleave to the Eye-lids, they then being immoveable. If Choler be the cauſe, there will be but little red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mingled with yellowneſs; the Humor which runs from the Eyes will be thin, the pain will be pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If flatuoſity or a vapour, then none of theſe ſigns will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, yet the Eyes will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſwelled, and a noiſe will be noted in the Ears, and no humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will flow from it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Nimae</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera depaſcentia</hi> are malign Ulcers, which ſometimes begin at the corners of the Eyes, ſometimes at the white, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeiſe upon the horny Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. In corrupt Bodies they fret exceedingly, and go forward in ſuch ſort, that oftentimes they conſume the parts adjacent, as the Muſoles and Lids of the Eye: from them flows a ſtinking ſlimy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the pain is grievous, and the diſeaſed party has an accidental Fever.</p>
                     <p>This Ulcer is dangerous, and ſeldom cured without deformity and loſs of the Sight: wherefore my counſel is, that you foretel the darger, if ſuch an Ulcer be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you to be cured.</p>
                     <p>Only I will acquaint you with ſome local means, having ſpoken ſufficiently of the general Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Apply then to the Ulcer the Juice of Plantain, Horſe-tail, Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, Night-ſhade, and Yarrow chrified with Hony, and the whites of Eggs: Dreſs theſe Ulcers Morning and Evening dropping a few drops into the affected Eye, covering the Eye with a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm made of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the pulp of a Quince boiled, and ſome Oyl of Poppies. If theſe Ulcers prove very malign and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding, you may correct them by inſtilling ſome Oyl of Vitriol, or Sulphur, mingled with Plantain-water, taking only the fourth part of it. To aſſwage the pain, uſe this Cataplaſm; ℞ <hi>Mala Cydonia numero</hi> 2. <hi>Sedi major. &amp; Solani bortenſ. ana man.</hi> ij. <hi>coq. in ſ. q.

It begins in the black of the Eye.</p>
                     <p>In it the black and white of the Eye are reddiſh, Lines ſeem to be ſent from the Black to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: the Patient refuſes Food, by reaſon of the exceeding great pain, a thin darkiſh and ſharp Humor flows from it, and it is exaſperated, by reaſon of the application of ſharp Medicaments.</p>

                     <p>Ulcers which are cauſed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſeaſes follow, as the Small Pox, the French Pox, and the Plague: If you fear that the Small Pox are like to cauſe Ulcers in the Eyes (which you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, if there was an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Eyes, before any did appear in the Body; if the party feel pain in the Eyes, and cannot open the Eye-lids) then are you to apply gentle Fomentations to the Eyes, and the Breaſt-milk of a ſound Woman, having a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron mingled with it; or the Mucilage of Fenugreek, Lin-ſeed and Quince-ſeeds, drawn with Roſe-water, having ſome Safforn added to it. You ſhall not need to look for any other Medicaments in theſe Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcers be Venereal, cauſed of the great Pox: then with all expedition are you to go about the cure of the main Grief, leſt blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs quickly enſue, and then to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to cure the Ulcers of the Eyes, which are but only ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the Diſeaſe, <hi>Renod. in diſpenſat. med. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 11. ſets down an excellent Eye-ſalve for this purpoſe, aſcribed to <hi>Lanfrank</hi> by the Neotericks, which he could not find in the Works of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank</hi> (as he confeſſes) ſo that by all likelyhood it is a magiſtral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.

                     <p>I will add a little of the Ulcer of the Eye cauſed of a Peſtilential <hi>Carbo,</hi> or <hi>Anthrax,</hi> and ſo end. In this Caſe, firſt there ariſes a ſmall Tumor in the Eye, hot, hard, painful, and contagious, cauſed of a thick, burned and venomous Humor: It is hot, the unnatural heat cauſing an ebullition of the Humor. It is hard, becauſe the heat burns the Humor: It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, by reaſon of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Humor which cauſeth it: when it yields Matter, it ſtinks by reaſon of the putrefaction of it.</p>
                     <p>It is accompanied with watching, drought, internal heat, raving, and the Urine is ſometimes of a fiery colour, ſometimes thick and troubled.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Symptoms appear, then are you firſt of all to miniſter ſuch Antidotes as are fit for a peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fever, as <hi>Theriac.

<q>Sometimes one of the Eye-lids grows to the other, ſo that the Eye cannot be opened: unto which Grief this inconvenience is often annexed, that the Eye-lids cleave to the white, as when a Sore in each, or both, has been negligently cured: for he has joyned them together in curing, which ought to have been kept aſunder: both theſe Griefs the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of theſe words of <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> we may gather, that there are two kinds of this Grief. The one is, when the Eye-lids cleave one to another: The other is, when the Eye-lids grow to the <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> and <hi>Cornea. Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meau</hi> notes that the firſt happens from the Nativity, as the <hi>Matrix</hi> is often ſhut up. This I will leave to that part of Chirurgery, called by me <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which teaches to disjoyn and ſeparate thoſe parts which are unnaturally united. As for the ſecond, ſeeing it is an Accident which hath happened to an Ulcer of the Eye negligently cured, I am not to let it paſs.</p>
                     <p>I marvel that <hi>Guilmeau,</hi> in the Book and Chapter aforenamed, pronounces out of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Meſue</hi> (not noting the places of the Authors) this Grief to be uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Seeing not only <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Aegineta,</hi> but he himſelf ſets down the manner of curing it, which he might well have ſpared, if he thought his labour loſt. Yea, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric. ab aq. pend. operat. chirurg. part.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. who in all Chirurgical Operations is very wary, injects no ſuch ſcruple; but boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the Cure: you are not to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52816:118"/>be daunted then by his diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. If the Eye-lid cleave to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> againſt the Apple of the Eye, the Sight never will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; becauſe the Scar will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſing of the <hi>Species viſibiles</hi> to the cryſtalline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
                     <p>As for the manner of Cure; it is performed by Manuul Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only: in this Operation go on thus: Having placed the Patient in that poſture as you ſhall think moſt convenient for your hand, lift up the Eye-lid, which cleaves to the Membranes, and put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eye-lids and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, in that part which is free (for never doth the Eye-lid whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleave to the Tunicles, as <hi>Aq. pendent.</hi> well obſerves) an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like to that which you call the capital Inſtrument, the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous or arched part being blunt, and having a back; but the belly being as ſharp as a Razor: when you have compaſſed all the part united, having turned the back of the Inſtrument towards the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, cunningly ſeparate the parts united, neither offending the Eye-lid, nor any Tunicle of the Eye. But if either of theſe muſt be touched, it is beſt that the Eye-lid, ſuffer, than any Tunicle: for it may more ſecurely ſuffer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. When this Operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if you be not vigilant in keeping the parts ſeparate afunder, they will eaſily unite again, as <hi>Celſus</hi> notes.</p>
                     <p>In ſetting down the Operations, <hi>Celſus</hi> calls the Inſtrument <hi>Specil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> As for that Inſtrument, which goes commonly amongſt the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents under the name of <hi>Specillion;</hi> it did abſolutely repreſent your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Spathula</hi>'s, being on the one end narrow and round, to ſerve for a Probe; ending in a round ſmall button, to hinder it from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when you are to try the depth of an Ulcer, or Wound, and on the other broad and flat, to ſpread your Unguents: of the broadeſt end <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Method.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 5. where he adviſes to beſprinkle an Ulcer with the Powder, uſing <hi>lats Specilli mucrone,</hi> with the broad end of the <hi>Specillum,</hi> or <hi>Spathula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that if (in putting in of the Inſtrument into the Eye, to comprehend the parts united) you fear to hurt any part with the point, then it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to arm it with a little Wax, that it may be like the end of a Probe.</p>
                     <p>To the parts thus ſeparated, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Collyrium</hi> made of Plantain-water, and <hi>Trochiſci albi Rhaſis ſine opio:</hi> diſſolving in an ounce of the Water, a drachm of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes.

Theſe Humors, if they be only ſharp, they produce Ulcers hard to be cured, but not of a grievous ſmell: Out of <hi>Galen</hi> then you may gather, that <hi>Polypodes</hi> are only Tumors in the Noſe, but <hi>Ozaenae</hi> are Ulcers. Secondly, that there are two ſorts of <hi>Ozaenae;</hi> the one is of thoſe which erode, being cauſed of the influxion only of ſharp Humors, but ſtink not. The other is of thoſe which ſmell grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, and are cauſed not only of ſharp Humors, as the former, but ſuch alſo as have Putrefaction annexed to the Eroſion, <hi>Actuar. lib.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. <hi>c.</hi> 10. ſo ſpeaks of this kind of Ulcer. <hi>Ozae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> manifeſts it ſelf by its very name, which it has taken from the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmell which it ſends out. It is cauſed when rotten and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humors gather about the <hi>Meatus colatorii,</hi> or the holes of of the <hi>Ethmoeides,</hi> and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their Malignity to the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent part, and infect others, which flow thither, with their ill ſmell. And tho at all times the breath of the Patient ſtink; yet it is chiefly obſerved in ſtrong expiration. <hi>Cel. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 6. thus writes: But if Ulcers be about the Noſtrils which have cruſt, and an evil ſmell (which the Grecians call <hi>Ozaenae</hi>) you are to underſtand, that this Grief can hardly be cured: ſo that you ſee, that to Eroſion and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction <hi>Celſus</hi> adds cruſts in an <hi>Ozaena. Gorraeus definitionum med.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52816:119"/>lib.</hi> 13. affirms that this Grief is more frequent in our times, than it was when the ancient Authors lived and practiſed: by reaſon of the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> or Pox, which hath gotten ſure footing in all Nations, and may be accompted the badge and character of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Luſts, and Gods judgment inflicted upon ſome for this hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ozaena</hi> of the Ancients was only a malign Ulcer: but Ulcers of the Noſe which are ſeen in the Pox, are ſymptoms of that Grief which is contagious, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact may infect others. <hi>Aegineta, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 24. affirms <hi>Ozaena</hi> to be a carious and rotten Ulcer, bred of ſharp Humors flowing to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and eroding them.</p>
                     <p>Out of the Diſcourſes of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, this deſcription of an <hi>Ozaena</hi> may be framed, Ozaena <hi>is a malign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer in the Noſtrils, about the holes of the</hi> Ethmoeides, <hi>cauſed of ſharp Humors eroding the parts, if no evil ſmell be adjoined; or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a putrefactive quality, if a noiſome ſmell accompany the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, ſometimes without, ſometimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cruſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cauſes antecedent are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſharp Humors flowing from the Brain, but ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Veins and Arteries, wherein ſuch Humors are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes conjunct are theſe ſame Humors impacted, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the part.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Ozaena</hi> is two-fold: for it is either not contagious, ſuch as the Ancients knew, or it is contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a ſymptom of the Venereal Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All ſorts of <hi>Ozaenae</hi> are of a malign Nature, becauſe ſuch is the Humor, which produces each one of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All ſuch Ulcers are of hard cure: Firſt, becauſe the Brain ſtill affords plenty of theſe corrupt Humors. Secondly, becauſe the part affected is of a moiſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. Thirdly, becauſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of internal Medicaments, which are preſcribed for correcting of the malignity of the Humors, is much abated before it come to the Head.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An <hi>Ozaena,</hi> a ſymptom of the Pox, is more eaſily cured, than that which is a Diſeaſe it ſelf: Firſt, becauſe the laſt comes nearer to a cancerous quality than the firſt: Secondly, becauſe we have more ſure Medicaments againſt the firſt than we have againſt the ſecond: if this kind of Ulcer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, it takes away the Senſe of Smelling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which is apparent is of eaſier cure than that which is hid or latent: ſeeing then ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, with unanimous conſent, pronounce the cure of an <hi>Ozaenae</hi> to be difficult, in ſetting down the Method of curing this Grief, my part is to ſhew what means Modern Practiſers by their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry have found out to remove this hardneſs of curing.</p>
                     <p>The means then which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the cure of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Ulcer are either Phyſical or Chirurgical.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſical are in number
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52816:119"/>three: to wit, obſervation of a good Diet, Phlebotomy and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Diet, that is moſt convenient which I ſet down in the two former Chapters, wherein I diſcourſed at large of the curing of Ulcers of the Eyes. If any one offer himſelf to be cured of ſuch an Ulcer, let him be tied to theſe Obſervations: Firſt of all, that he ſhun all ſorts of Meats, which are either of an hard concoction, or afford a corrupt and evil Juice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he uſe great modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the uſe of wholſom and convenient Food.</p>
                     <p>Faſting often in this caſe is very requiſite; Firſt, becauſe it dries the habit of the Body: Secondly, becauſes it furthers concoction: Thirdly, becauſe by faſting thoſe Vapors are digeſted, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would mount up to the Head. And tho in the beginning, while the Body is fraught with ſharp Humors, the Sore may be exaſperated by faſting; yet after that the Body is clean, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of ſuch Humors, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent evacuations, you ſhall find the commodity of faſting: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the Dinner muſt not be riotous, and the Supper very ſpare.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Phyſical means is Phlebotomy: If the Body be ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therick. Firſt, open the <hi>Cephalica</hi> of the right Arm in Spring and Sammer; but of the Left, in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and Winter. Then three or four days afterward, open the Veins under the Tongue, which will ſerve for derivation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, as the former did for revulſion of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This muſt much further the Cure: For firſt, Phlebotomy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the quantity of the Humors contained in the maſs of Blood: Secondly, it makes way for the receiving of better Blood into the Veſſels, which of neceſſity muſt enſue after the appointing of a convenient Diet, and exquiſite purging of the Body, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Phlebotomy is to be performed.</p>
                     <p>The third Phyſical mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the cure of an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> was ſaid to be purging of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by Cathartical Medicaments: for vomitive Medicaments are not ſo convenient as Cathartical, in the Diſeaſes of the Head, unleſs the Stomach be foul, and peſtered with raw and corrupt Humors, which require a long time for concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Vomitions (as is confeſſed by all Practiſers) ſend up Vapors to the Head.</p>
                     <p>Theſe purging Medicaments are of two forts: for they are either Vegetable or Mineral.</p>
                     <p>As for the Vegetable Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they muſt be of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which are appointed for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening of the Head of ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: ſuch are Agarick, <hi>Turpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Coloquint, Scammony, black Ellebore. But ſeeing the purgative Simples are ſeldom miniſtred alone, I will ſhew unto you what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicaments are ſitteſt to be uſed in this Caſe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound purgative Medicaments are either Pills or Potions.</p>
                     <p>As for Pills: If the Humors be mixed, then uſe <hi>Extractum Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymagogicum</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> or the <hi>Pilul. extract. Rudii;</hi> of them miniſter half a drachm for a doſe:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52816:120"/>Let the Patient uſe this Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment twice a Week. If Choler and Phlegm corrupted be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cauſe of the Ulcer, then mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Pills called <hi>Sine quibus eſſe nolo.</hi> If thick and groſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors be the cauſe, miniſter <hi>Pilulae anreae, &amp; Cocciae,</hi> if corrupt Phlegm be the cauſe, miniſter <hi>Pilulae de Agarico.</hi> Of theſe Pills miniſter one drachm for a doſe: let the number of the Pills be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſwallowing of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient be hard to be moved to ſtool, you may actuate, and make the Pills more effectual, by adding to every doſe of the Pills four grains of the Trochiſes of <hi>Albandal,</hi> and three grains of <hi>Diacrydium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the party cannot ſwallow Pills; then you are to miniſter Potions. The Electuaries moſt fit for this purpoſe, are <hi>Diacatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum, Caryocoſtinum, Diaphaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Electuarium de ſucco Roſarum, Confectio Hamech, Diacarthamum,</hi> Of theſe Electuaries, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Syrups, diſtilled Waters, or Decoctions, you may make Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fitting the conſtitutions of the parties grieved.</p>
                     <p>For one of a cholerick Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution miniſter ſuch a Potion: ℞ <hi>Caryoceſtin. &amp; Electuar. de ſucco Roſ. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>Syrup. de Cichor. cum rhab.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>aq. Endiviae</hi> ℥ iij. <hi>Miſc. ut ſiat potio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the party be of a phlegmatick Conſtitution, miniſter this Potion: ℞ <hi>Diaphaen. &amp; Diacarthami, an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>Syrupi Roſ. ſolut. cum Agarico</hi> ℥ j. <hi>aq. Beton.</hi> ℥ iij. <hi>Miſc. ut fiat potio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the diſeaſed perſon be of a melancholick Temperature, then miniſter this Potion: ℞ <hi>Confect. Hamech.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iv. <hi>Diacartham.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>Syrupi Auguſtani.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>aquae Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi> ℥ iij. <hi>Miſc. ut fiat petio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you may purge the Body with vegetable Medicaments, if the Body of the diſeaſed party be weak, or if you fear the uſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. But let me inſinuate ſo much unto you, that Mineral Medicaments, if they be well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, are moſt effectual, and if they be miniſtred by a skilful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſer, howſoever they are ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed by thoſe who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the denomination of Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, amongſt whom ſome may be found, whoſe Skill is inferior to the Envy of an Underſtanding Man.</p>
                     <p>Mineral Medicaments are more ſubtil and piercing than Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſooner alter the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the party unto whom they are miniſtred. Theſe Medicaments are moſt commonly taken from Antimony and Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Antimony which purges moſt by ſtool is excellent. The Sulphur of Antimony drawn by Art from the Recrements of the <hi>Regulus</hi> is good; as alſo the <hi>Regulus</hi> it ſelf calcined and ſixed with Saltpeter, and brought to a white Powder. The Glaſs of it, and <hi>Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum,</hi> are not ſo convenient and ſecure, becauſe they procure ſtrong Vomitions.</p>
                     <p>There be divers preparations of Mercury which are very effectual; as Mercury precipitate with <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the Oyl of Vitriol or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, with Gold or Silver, or precipitate, alone without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any thing. There is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52816:120"/>ſcarce a Chirurgeon, who is not able by one preparation or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of Mercury to procure Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Mercurial Medicaments are effectual, as well in an <hi>Ozaena</hi> which is a primary Diſeaſe, or of it ſelf, as in that which is a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Pox. You have ſeen what Diet is moſt convenient, and what internal Medicaments are moſt effectual in curing of an <hi>Ozaena:</hi> The laſt point which I propounded unto my ſelf, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Cure of this Ulcer, was the right uſe of external Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are in number two; to wit, local Medicaments, and an actual cautery.</p>
                     <p>As for local Medicaments, they are either Waters, or Decoctions, or Unguents: But before you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any Medicaments, to mundifie, incarnate, or cicatrize, you muſt labour to remove the cruſty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which doth fix it ſelf in the forepart of the <hi>Ethmoides,</hi> or <hi>Os Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the removing of the cruſty ſubſtance, I commend unto you two Medicaments:</p>

                     <p>If you mean to procure an Eſchar, both the ends of the Pipe by which the Cautery is carried, muſt be open: but if you intend deſiccation, the end which you apply to the Ulcer, muſt be ſhut.</p>

                     <p>NOw am I to diſcourſe of ſuch Ulcers as befall the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Taſte, which is the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>It begins at the Lips, and reaches to the beginning of the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and the <hi>Gula,</hi> or Mouth of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>It hath four Uſes: 1. It ſerves for Breathing, by ſending freſh Air unto the Lungs, and diſcharging ſuliginous Vapors ſent from the heart by the <hi>Arteria venoſa.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. It ſerves for Speaking: the external and internal parts of it ſerving for the framing of the Voice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It ſerves for diſcharging of the excrements of the Brain, by ſpitting out the excrements of the Lungs by expectoration, and by diſcharging the excrements of the Stomach by vomiting.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then the Uſes of it are ſo manifold and neceſſary, it behoves me to diſcover ſuch Diſeaſes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our purpoſe) as deprive us of one or more of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Lips afford a ſixfold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to the Life of Man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They ſerve for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Eating and Drinking, for they keep in the Meat until it be chewed.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. They keep in the Spittle of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They keep the Teeth and Gums from external injuries.</p>

None I aſſure you, for theſe Medicaments are familiar to Nature, and are true Balſames for malign Sores.</p>
                     <p>But you may ask what was the reaſon that theſe Medicaments were not uſed?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, becauſe there was no mention made of theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the firſt, and it was too late to miniſter them at the laſt, Nature being ſurprized; for this only would have made the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament odious, and the Phyſician (who ſhould have adviſed this courſe) obnoxious to calumny and reproach.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>If they be mild and ordinary, the former Medicaments ſet down for the cure of the Tongue will be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>But if it be a fretting Ulcer, firſt you are to admoniſh the Patient of ſome accidents, which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue:

                     <p>The Firſt is, That if the <hi>

                     <p>The Second accident is, the danger of a <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> or Cough of the Lungs; for this is to be feared, ſeeing the member which did hinder the ruſhing in of the cold Air into the Lungs, and put back from the Breaſt Humors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling from the Head, is wholly taken away.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Lungs draw more nouriſhment to themſelves by their motion, heat, and pain, than they are able to digeſt,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe the Ulcer like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Wolf by its malignity and filth, preſently corrupts the Blood ſent for nouriſhment unto the Lungs, turning the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Now Ulcers of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or of the lower Belly, do offer themſelves only to be but compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly touched. Seeing there are three parts of it, <hi>Regio Epigastrica, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilicalis,</hi> and <hi>Hypogastrica,</hi> the upper, the Umbilical, and lower Region; I am to ſhew unto you what parts in theſe Regions moſt commonly ſuffer ulceration.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw the Stomach of one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſs <hi>Ferne,</hi> together with the Muſcles perforated by the Eroſion of a ſharp Humor, in the <hi>Howlt,</hi> a Town diſtant from <hi>Chester</hi> five Miles: the Meat, Drink and Chyle came thorow the perforation: the Ulcer alſo ſmelled ſtrongly. I being unwilling to deal with her, preſcribed ſome local means, which wrought but ſmall effect; for ſhe died of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, within a ſhort time: the Ulcer hindring the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Aliment, and ſo defrauding the Body of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My Opinion was then, and now is, that Ulcers penetrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cavity of the Stomach are mortal, tho Wounds of this kind be ſometimes cured: for in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond there is but a bare Solution of continuty; but in the former there is a Solution of continuity having annexed to it the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malignity of a Matter. Here in <hi>London,</hi> in an Inn a little above <hi>Fleet</hi>-conduit, one <hi>Richard,</hi> who was Tapſter of the Inn, had for a long time a great pain in the right Side of the Epigaſtrical Region of the <hi>Abdanen:</hi> In progreſs of time there appeared a great hard Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, cauſing a ſharp Fever: at laſt the Plegmon breaking of it ſell, ſent out great ſtore of Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. I then lodging at the Sign of the Naked Boy, a little below the Conduit, was ſent for, finding him in a ſtrong Fever, and having difficulty of breathing, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Liver hindring the free motion of the <hi>Septum tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſum,</hi> the Inſtrument of Natural Reſpiration, I pronounced his Grief to be mortal, and ſo it fell out: for tho no rational means were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fit to have recovered the party, if the Grief had been cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the party died. It were but fruitleſs labour to ſet down the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments which were uſed, ſeeing they prevailed not.</p>
                     <p>This Hiſtory I thought good to ſet down, that you may imagine what the Event is like to be, if you ſhould be called to the like Grief.</p>
                     <p>It falls out ſometimes, that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous fleſh grows above the Navel, if it be ſlackly bound, and be left ſomewhat long, which doth become ulcerate: This I ſaw once in <hi>Taveſtock,</hi> a Town in the Weſt Country, in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> in a Child of Maſter <hi>Moon</hi>'s, a Draper of that Town. I having been called to the Cure, firſt bound off the Navel by a ſtrong Ligature, afterwards I cured it by the Application of <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the Groin after a Phlegmon of it opened, oftentimes an Ulcer is left, penetrating thorow the oblique and tranſverſe Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen:</hi> If you perceive ſuch an Ulcer, pronounce it not to be of eaſie cure, chiefly if it fall out to be after a Venereal <hi>Babo:</hi> For firſt, there is <hi>Morbus cum cauſa,</hi> a Grief having the cauſe annexed: Secondly, it corrupts the Fibres of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52816:130"/>the Muſcles: Thirdly, it corrupts ſometimes the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins, in which caſe all Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fruitleſs, becauſe the grief is mortal: This happened to a young Woman, who dwelt with the Lady <hi>Lucie,</hi> whom Maſter <hi>Napkin</hi> dreſſed, and opened after her death. Both Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi> and I were called to view the Sore ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times; and thô means were uſed for her recovery, yet they did not prevail; ſo that ſhe died of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> the Body becoming extremely extenuate; although ſhe ſeemed to be of a firm and thick habit of Body, when the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor firſt appeared. If any ſuch Tumors come to your hands, after they are brought to maturation, uſe the general means preſcribed for the cure of a <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> leſt the like event happen to you.</p>
                     <p>I will touch briefly the cure of Ulcers of the Joints, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but very little from the cure of Ulcers in other parts, ſaving that they require Medicaments of more deſiccation without any ſharpneſs, and more powerfull anodyne cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plalins for aſſwaging of pain, which is, an inſeparable accident of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſeizing upon theſe parts.</p>

                     <p>In curing of theſe Ulcers often purging is required, to ſtay the flowing of ſharp Humors; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every purgative Medicament is not of like efficacy, I will ſet down one as a pattern, after which you may frame others: ℞ <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Of this Treatiſe there ſhall be Two parts. In the Firſt I will ſet down thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Wounds in general. In the Second Part I will ſhew how Wounds of the ſeveral parts of the Body, which require ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, are to be cured.</p>
                     <p>In the general Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wounds, I will ſet down theſe three things; The Firſt ſhall be of the nature of a Wound: The Second of the general Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of Cure: The Third ſhall be of the laſt ſcope of the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Nature of a Wound is made manifeſt by ſetting down, Firſt, what a Wound is; Secondly,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52816:131"/>which be the main differences of Wounds. In ſhewing what a Wound is, Firſt I muſt deliver the denomination of it: Secondly, the deſcription of it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Wound</hi> ſo called in Engliſh, in Latine is termed <hi>Vulnus,</hi> and in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Now to ſet down the variety of deſcriptions that are aſſigned by Authors, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Monuments of this ſubject to poſterity, it would prove a task more laborious than fruitful: and the examination of them would ſerve rather for oſtentation, than edification. Moſt of them which are ſet down by modern Writers, will not endure the trial of the Laws required by Logicians in a good Definition. Wherefore I will leave the refutation of the eſcapes committed by Authors in this matter, which only teaches what is not to be learned. <hi>Hieron.

                           </gap>a pendente.</hi> The manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a wound is termed by me Inciſion, or Diviſion by cutting: and this term makes the difference between a Wound and a Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for as a Contuſion is cauſed by a blunt Inſtrument forcibly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; ſo a Wound is inflicted by a ſharp Inſtrument inciſing. Thus you have the deſcription of a Wound, and the explication of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of it briefly ſet down: By which you may examine the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitions of others who have written of this ſubject, when you ſhall take them into your hands.</p>
                     <p>The Second point which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed fully to make up the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Wound was, of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of it. And in ſetting down of theſe, expect not the full enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all which may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as thoſe taken from the quantity, whereby a Wound may becalled great or ſmall; or from the time and continuance, from whence a Wound may be ſaid to benew or old, and ſuch like, which muſt be touched in the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of every particular Wound. Onely I will deliver ſuch as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more inwardly from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Wound. Then a Wound is either ſuch a one as was known to the ancient Writers, or was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: the Wounds known to the ancients are either ſimple or compound: the compound are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mild or malign: the malign are either cauſed by a poiſoned weapon, or bitings, or ſtingings of venemous creatures. The Wounds which were not known to the ancients, are thoſe which are made by Gun-ſhot. Here you have the requiſite and neceſſary diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Wounds, which do cauſe ſome variation in the cutting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Eyes of your Mind, as in a Table which in my proceeding I mean to handle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely. So much then ſhall be ſufficient to have been ſet down concerning the nature of a Wound, which I affirmed in the beginning to be manifeſted, by delivering the deſcription of a Wound, and the divers kinds of it: Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that I ſpeak of the Second general point, to wit, of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Prognoſticks of Cure in Wounds. Whenſoever then a wounded perſon is preſented unto you to foretell the event with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out error, you are to conſider that Wounds are two-fold: for they are either mild, which are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cured, as a ſmall wound in a fleſhy part; or they are grievous, and cured with ſome difficulty at the leaſt. Grievous Wounds are either <hi>periculoſa,</hi> or <hi>malefica,</hi> or <hi>lethalia,</hi> or <hi>difficilia, Periculoſa,</hi> or dangerous Wounds, are ſuch as ſometimes are cured, thô for the moſt part they bring death; ſuch are ſuperficial wounds of the Brain. <hi>Difficilia,</hi> or Wounds of hard cure, are ſuch as may be cured, if they be skilfully dreſſed; but if they be not handled by a cunning Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52816:132"/>penetrating wounds of the Breaſt, <hi>Malefica,</hi> or miſchievous Wounds, are ſuch as leave a hurt ſtill after them, when they are cured: ſuch is a Wound by which a Muſcle is cut tranſverſe quite aſunder; for then the uſe of that part is taken away, which was moved by that Muſcle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lethalia,</hi> or deadly Wounds, are ſuch as bring inevitable death: ſuch are Wounds which divide the great veſſels near to the Liver or Heart. So the noble D. of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> was diſpatched by a wound which he received in the <hi>Arteria venoſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you would know to which of theſe a Wound (which is offered to you to be cured) is to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you muſt diligently examine theſe four things: Firſt, the part affected. Secondly, the adjuncts of the Wound. Thirdly, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body. Fourthly, the things not natural.</p>
                     <p>As for the part, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Firſt, its Dignity: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, its Subſtance: Thirdly, the temperature: Fourthly, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: Fifthly, the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the bigneſs and number: Laſtly, the uſe of the part.</p>
                     <p>Adjuncts to be conſidered in a Wound are theſe: the bigneſs, the Figure, the Situation, the Symptomes, and laſt of all, other diſeaſes complicate with the wound, as the French pox, or Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>As for the habit of the Body, you are to conſider, whether it be good or ill, of a looſe or a firm ſubſtance, whether it be full or extenuate: neither is the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of it to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>As for the things not natural, as Air, Meat, and Drink, ſleeping and Watching, and the reſt of them, I will ſhew the uſe of them when I am come to the conſideration of every particular Wound.</p>
                     <p>Now it follows, that I ſhew you the uſe of theſe Prognoſtical Springs or Fountains, by ſetting down ſome Predictions derived from them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a noble part, the Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Faculty, in continual motion, the Body being of an ill habit, receiving a great wound, muſt of neceſſity cauſe death: By Induction I will make this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Heart being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, cauſes either a ſudden or ſpeedy death. Firſt, becauſe it is a principal part: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural Faculty proceeds from it: Thirdly, becauſe it is in continual motion: Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of a hard and compact ſubſtance, and ſo not eaſily united: Fifthly, becauſe it is a very hot part, and ſo very ſubject to inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Sixthly, becauſe it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and there is no other part which can perform the function of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Wounds of the Brain in like manner are deadly, if they penetrate to the <hi>Baſis:</hi> Becauſe it is a principal part, the well-ſpring of the animal faculty, in continual motion: and becauſe Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſharp Fever enſues. If a wound of the Brain be only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, it is to be accounted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous; partly becauſe the motion is gentle, partly becauſe the ſubſtance of the part is ſoft, and ſo apt to receive Conſolidation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſmall Wounds of the Liver, thô they be dangerous;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52816:132"/>yet they may admit Conſolidation: Firſt, becauſe the ſubſtance of the Liver is like coagulate Blood, and ſo may eaſily be united: Secondly, becauſe if one part of it be wounded, the other will do its Office; as we may obſerve in thoſe, the part of whoſe Liver is poſſeſſed with a ſcirrhous Tumor.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, a Wound received in the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> within the Belly or Breaſt is deadly: Firſt, by reaſon of its ſubſtance; for being nervous, it hardly admits Conſolidation:</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by reaſon of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it; for a Chirurgeon can hardly come to it to apply any lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Wounds in the fleſhy parts of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ff, are dangerous: Firſt, becauſe we cannot come to dreſs them: Secondly, becauſe it is in continual motion: Thirdly, becauſe the parts within the Breaſt are eaſily infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But if it be wounded in the nervous parts, inevitable death enſues, becauſe a <hi>delirium</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the inflammation always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, and ſometimes a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Wounds of the Lungs are ſometimes deadly, if a great veſſel in them be divided, as the <hi>Vena arterioſa.</hi> Yet if the party live, they prove moſt commonly m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>chievous, leaving a <hi>Fiſtula:</hi> of the cure of which I diſcourſed in my Treatiſe of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, Wounds of the Spleen, if they be not great, and procure not an Hemorrhage, they are not deadly: Becauſe it is neither a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part, nor the Origination of any Faculty; but only appointed by Nature to be a Receptacle of ſaeculent and black melancholick Blood.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Wounds of the <hi>Coſtis fellis</hi> bring death at laſt, thô ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Firſt, becauſe we cannot come to it conveniently to apply ſit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. Secondly, becauſe it is of a nervous ſubſtance, which doth not eaſily admit unition. Thirdly, becauſe the Humor which it ought to contain until the time of excretion; corrupts the parts, unto which it is ſent.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, a Wound in the mouth of the Stomach is grievous: Firſt, becauſe it is of an exquiſite Senſe. Secondly, becauſe fearful ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and ſwoundings and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings enſue. Thirdly, becauſe there muſt be a difficulty of ſwallowing.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, Wounds of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, if they paſs not to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, bring not inevitable death: yea, ſome are of opinion, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>extraction of ſtones out of the Kidneys by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> may ſafely be adminiſtred. Of this operation I will ſpeak in its own place.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, Wounds of the ſmall Guts are for the moſt part deadly: Firſt, becauſe they are of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ſubſtance: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of an exquiſite Senſe. But Wounds in the thick, Guts are more eaſily cured; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſubſtance is more thick and ſo admits more promptly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination; and being not ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as the ſmall Guts are, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and other fearful ſymptomes do not ſo frequently invade.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if one be wounded in the Meſentery, inevitable death muſt enſue: Firſt, becauſe there muſt be a great Flux of Blood by reaſon of the multitude of Veins in it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe we cannot eaſily
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52816:133"/>come thither, to apply local means: Thirdly, becauſe the Chyle is ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from paſſing to the Blood; and ſo Sanguification is hindred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Body cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>I did affirm ſome Wounds to be <hi>maligna,</hi> or miſchievous, which leave ſome hurt or imperfection in the parts after they are cured: of ſuch receive theſe Examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a Wound above the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, with a Fracture of the Scull, when the Wound is incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, can hardly be brought to a cicatrice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Brain be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably wounded, the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fooliſh, and more ſtupid than he was before.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the bottom of the Stomach be wounded, imbecillity and weakneſs of Concoction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if a Nerve or a Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ties Bones together, or a Muſcle be tranſverſly cut aſunder, motion is hindred.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, when the <hi>Glarea,</hi> or the ſubſtance which is found in the great Joints to moiſten them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Whites of Eggs, is let out by a Wound, the Joint grows ſtiff; and ſo the motion is impaired.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving in the former Chapter ſet down the two firſt Points of the general Doctrine of Wounds, to wit, the Nature of a Wound, and the Fountains from whence Prognoſticks of Wounds are fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and having by propounding ſome Examples ſhewed the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them: Now I am to ſet down the third general Point, which is the laſt ſcope and end which the Chirurgeon propoſes to himſelf, when he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cure any Wound; and that is the Unition of the parts joyned.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, then I will ſet down the divers ſorts of Unition or Union of the parts; then the Cauſes which procure this Union.</p>
                     <p>Of Union then there are two kinds; the firſt is called <hi>Symphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> or Agglutination, or Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſecond is named <hi>Syſſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſis,</hi> Colligation, or Concarnation. <hi>Symphyſis</hi> is the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nition of parts
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52816:133"/>disjoyned, no middle ſubſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of Union is ſaid by Chirurgeons to be performed by the firſt Intention. And if the team of the firſt Intention or Scope were not ſo to be taken, that would be abſolutely falſe, which <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> 6. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> 19. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the <hi>Praeputium</hi> or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin being cut aſunder, doth not admit Unition. But it is not to be doubted, but that it will admit Conſolidation by a fleſhy ſubſtance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>iting the parts disjoyned: tho this cannot be done by meer Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination. And whereas <hi>Galen,</hi> 90. <hi>Art. Medic.</hi> avers Union in the inſtrumental parts to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; to make this good which he affirms, we muſt obſerve one thing, that in this place an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental part is not taken in its ampleſt ſignification, by which it comprehends all parts that are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial to other parts: and ſo Veins and Arteries are inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal parts; becauſe they ſerve the the Heart for diſtribution of Blood and Spirits for the maintenance and good of the Body. But an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentary part is here taken as it is oppoſite to a ſimple part: for all the parts of the Body are either ſimple, as the Fleſh, Veins, Fibres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or compound or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, as a Finger; and ſo inſtrumental parts taken in this ſignification are not united by <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſis,</hi> they being wounded; but by <hi>Syſſercoſis,</hi> that is, not after the firſt, but ſecond Intention. And ſo <hi>Galen</hi> in 91. <hi>cap.</hi> following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf: where talking of a Wound in a Bone, he ſays, <hi>But if a Bone ſuffer Solution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, it cannot be united, as I ſaid:</hi> And he addeth this Clauſe, <hi>Yet may be united by the ſecond Scope.</hi> He means by the growing of a fleſhy ſubſtance between the parts of the Bone ſevered.</p>
                     <p>But you may demand of me, what parts admit Unition by <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſis,</hi> or the firſt Intention?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that the fleſhy parts disjoyned admit this ſort of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidation in all the Periods of Life, and the Spermatick Parts before the ſeventh year be expired, a Bone being excepted: but they are only united by the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention after the ſeventh year ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of Unition of parts ſevered by a Wound is called by <hi>Galen de comp. Med. ſecund. loc. cap. de plaga, Syſſarcoſis:</hi> and it is nothing elſe but <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of parts disjoyned, by a middle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> Now this Subſtance is ſometimes like the parts which it unites, as in Wounds in fleſhy parts: or it reſembles not the part which it unites, as in Wounds of the ſpermatick parts after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year.</p>
                     <p>Having delivered unto you the two kinds of the Union or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation of parts ſeparated by a Wound, now I come to the Cauſes of Unition or Conſolidation of the parts ſeparated. Theſe Cauſes are either efficient Cauſes, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. The efficient Cauſes are two, to wit, Nature, and the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon. Nature out of doubt is the chief efficient Cauſe; for ſhe ever labouring to preſerve her ſelf, ſends unto the parts of the Body ſo much of the natural Balſam of it as is ſufficient to unite the parts
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52816:134"/>disjoyned. If you would know what I mean by the term of the natural Balſam, I mean the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Alimentary Moiſture, the ſeat of the natural heat, by which two every <hi>individuum</hi> or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon is maintained, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                     <p>Now there are four things which may hinder Nature from effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Union of parts disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The firſt is an evil Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as when the brims of a Wound are not proportionally and handſomly united and ſet together. The ſecond is the continuance of this ill Conformation. The third is an unnatural Body remaining in the Wound: this unnatural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is either unnatural by Event, as a ſhiver of a Bone ſeparated from the whole, or by its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as when a piece of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which wounded doth ſtick in the Wound. The fourth is the Diſtemperature of the wounded part: for if it be either too hot, or too cold, the Diſtemperature muſt be removed, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temperature reſtored, before Unition can be expected or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond efficient Cauſe of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of parts ſevered by a Wound, I affirmed to be the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon: he is the Miniſter, not the Lord of Nature, and is only to further her deſigns, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to remove the Lets and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which may hinder her from attaining her purpoſe, which is the Reſtitution of the parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to their natural Union. The Chirurgeon then is to perform ſome Duties. Now theſe Duties are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common to both kinds of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to wit, <hi>Symphyſis</hi> and <hi>Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarcoſis,</hi> or they are proper to each. The common Duties are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeven, Firſt, the ſtaying of Blood. Second, the removing of ſtrange Bodies from the Wound. Third, proviſion that no ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fall into the Wound. Fourth, that he maintain the natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the part. Fifth, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e reſtore it, if it be loſt. Sixth, the conſideration of the Quittour and Excrements, which flow from the Wound. Seventh, is the removing of general Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>In the ſtaying of Blood the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon is to ſet two things before his Eyes: The firſt is, how much Blood he is to ſuffer to flow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtay it, if the wounded perſon muſt loſe any Blood? The ſecond is, by what means the Blood is to be ſtayed?</p>
                     <p>As for the quantity of Blood which is to be ſuffered to flow; you may ſuffer it to flow plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if the party be of a ſanguine conſtitution, have a ſleſhy habit of the Body, if the Veins be large, and if the Seaſon be hot; for this hinders Inflammation to enſue. If you find Indications contrary to theſe, then it muſt flow but ſparingly; for it is the Treaſure of Life.</p>
                     <p>The means of ſtaying of the Blood are in number eight.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, the application of Pledgets, or Doſils of Lint or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52816:134"/>may take one part of Vinegar, and two only of Water. This mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called <hi>Poſca:</hi> it muſt be applied warm; for cold Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are hurtful to Wounds.

                        </gap>dnary pain will be cauſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the deligation of a Veſſel is, that the binding be not too ſtrait, becauſe ſo the Veſſel ſhall be cut aſunder too ſoon, and ſo a new fluxion ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                     <p>The Thread, wherewith the Veſſel is bound, muſt be either of ſtrong Silk or Steel-hemp, as they term it, ſuch is ſealing Thread: For theſe are not ſo ſubject to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and ſo there is leſs fear of a new Hemorrhage, which would prove more dangerous than the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The third mean to ſtay bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the application of Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or Incarnative Medicaments. Such is that which <hi>Galen</hi> preſcribes, 5. <hi>Method.</hi> 4. of Aloes, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, the Down of a Hare, and the White of an Egg, all being brought to the conſiſtence of Hony. In tender Bodies, take one part of Frankincenſe, and two of Aloes: In hard Bodies, one part of Aloes, and two of Frankincenſe. In thoſe, who have a mean habit of Body, uſe equal parts of both. <hi>Olibanum in guttis</hi> is better than Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. Apply this Medicament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pledgets or Doſils of Lint or Two. The manner of dreſſing is this. Couch the Veſſel with the Finger, then cleanſe the Wound from the clotted Blood, and all moiſture, with a piece of Sponge wet in red Wine, or any aſtringent Decoction. Afterwards beſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the parts of the Wound about your Finger, with the Powder of Aloe and Frankincenſe. Then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Pledget or a Doſil armed with the forenamed Medicament, which preſently preſs down with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52816:135"/>your Finger. Laſt of all, keeping down the Applications either with your Finger, or with a Probe, fill up the Wound with Pledgets or Doſils armed. This being done, nothing remains, but to apply a double Cloth moiſtned in ſome aſtringent Liquor, and wrung, to the wounded part, and to roul it up; begin to roul below the Wound; when you are come to the Wound, compaſs it with three or four Circumvolutions: Then aſcend and roul the part above the Wound, to preſs the Blood out of the Veſſel, and ſo the flux of Blood will be ſtayed. You are not to open the Wound afterward, but either upon the third or fourth day. Then all the Pledgets or Doſils, except the laſt, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cleaves to the Veſſel, are to be taken away, and new ones to be applied; the wounded parts having been beſprinkled with more of the Powder. Thus you are to dreſs the Wound every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, until the part be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and no fear be left of any more bleeding.</p>
                     <p>The fourth way to ſtay bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the injection of aſtringent Medicaments; if we cannot come to reach to the Veſſel with the Finger, by reaſon of the depth of the Wound, ſuch are Bole Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, <hi>terra ſigillata,</hi> marking ſtone, <hi>Hypocyſtis, ſanguis Draconis,</hi> new Galls, Juice of Sloes, Plantain, Comfrey, Knotgraſs, Milfoil, Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, and Leeks; of theſe you may frame ſuch Compoſitions as this is: ℞ <hi>Succi conſol.

                     <p>The fifth way to ſtay bleeding is in the tranverſe ſection and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſunder of a great Veſſel, which pours out the Blood. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a horrible eſſuſion of Blood follows after a Wound, you may gather that the Veſſel is not cut aſunder tranverſe, unleſs there be an enormous ſeparation of the parts wounded, not differing much from diſmembring: for if the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be cut tranverſe wholly aſund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you be driven to uſe the actual Cautery, then you are to obſerve two things in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The firſt is, that you cleanſe the Wound from cloſted Blood, that the Veſſel may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, otherwiſe you having burned only the coagulate Blood, you ſhall think the burnt Blood to be a Cruſt cauſed in the Veſſel, which is not ſo; and ſo the next day it being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Being intreated by the ſick party and the Earl, to perform this Operation, I yielded unto their requeſt; but having by me neither Inſtrument nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, thus I ſupplied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of both: I made a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Umber and unſlaked Lime, taking equal parts of both, which I found there, the Houſe then being in reparation; I uſed a Joyners Whip-ſaw newly touched: And in the preſence of two Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When I dreſſed the Wound the fourth day, I found the Mouths of all the Veſſels ſhut by incarnation, ſo powerful was the reſtrictive Medicament, made of equal quantities of Umber and unſlaked Lime, rubbed to a fine Powder, and reduced to the form of a Liniment by the addition of the Whites of Eggs beaten, and the Down of an Hare. <hi>Fallopius</hi> in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52816:136"/>his Book of Wounds hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious device, which is this. He will have you to take a Reed, which in bigneſs is anſwerable to the capacity of the Wound. The one end being ſtopped with a Cork, he will have you to fill it with German or Hungarian Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol melted; when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol is cold, it is to be thruſt in one end an inch without the Reed, and to be kept to the Veſſel for the ſpace of an hour; in which ſpace of time the Mouth of the Veſſel will be ſhut firmly.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, a Flux of Blood is ſtayed by opening of a Vein in the oppoſite ſide, tho much Blood hath been loſt; but the Blood muſt be drawn leiſurely; Beſides this, the extremities of the Body muſt be bound with reaſonable ſtrait Ligatures, where it ſhall ſeem beſt to the skilful Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p>The eighth way to ſtay Blood, is to cool tho whole Body: for ſo the Blood is congealed, and made unapt to flow: This is performed two manner of ways: Firſt, in letting down the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party, laid in a Sheet, into a Bath of extreme cold Water, to procure a Lipothymy or Fainting; and by this the Spirits return from the extremities of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Center.

                        </gap>e extraneous of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are either ſoft, as pieces of the wounded mans Garments; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Having deſcribed, as it were in a Table, the divers ſorts of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies (to help the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) which are able to hinder the parts disioyned in a Wound, as long as they continue in the Wound; I am now to deliver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the ways and means by which they are to be removed, and taken out of Wounds.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, then, things extraneous accidentally, as clotted Blood, Hair, Dirt or Gravel, they may be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with Claret or white Wine warmed, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Water, <hi>Oxymel</hi> diſſolved in Water: or if you be in the Country, where theſe things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, you may uſe Milk, or Beer, or Ale warmed. You are not to omit cleanſing of the Wound with a Probe armed with Lint. If ſplints of Bones, or pieces of Fleſh, Membranes, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, or Ligaments ſtick in the Wound, you are to take them out either with your <hi>Forceps</hi> or Ravens Bill.</p>
                     <p>Having ſhewed you, how things accidentally extraneous, which might hinder Unition of the Wound, are to be removed; now I muſt in like manner ſet down
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52816:137"/>how Bodies of their own Nature extraneous, which ſtick in the Wounds and hinder Conſolidation, as pieces of Weapons, Bullets, and ſuch like, are to be taken out. In the extraction of theſe Bodies, you are to ſet before your Eyes theſe two things; to wit, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of them; as for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, theſe two are to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that you attempt not the extraction of ſuch Bodies as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with great difficulty, pain and danger be drawn out, and with the which remaining in the Body the Wound may be cured; ſuch are Bullets ſticking deeply in the great Joynts, as the Elbow and the Knee.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that you go not about the extraction of ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if you ſee the Wound to be Mortal, and that the Party muſt Die, the Prognoſtick of ſuch Wounds I delivered unto you in the firſt Chapter of Wounds, whither I remit you: for if you draw out the Weapon wherewith a great Veſſel of the Liver or Heart is wounded, you ſhall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Death: ſo the pulling of <hi>Feiton</hi>'s Knife out of the Body of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Venuſa</hi> having been wounded, procured ſpeedy Death. So much then of the Circumſtances to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, before the drawing out of extraneous Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Now I will acquaint you with the means, by which they are to be removed: The means are two: Medicaments and Inſtruments. We uſe Medicaments; Firſt, when the Extraction cannot eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; as when we cannot lay hold upon the extraneous Body by any fit Inſtrument: Secondly, when there is no ſuſpicion that the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon was poyſoned, or that Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is not like to enſue. If therefore a Thorn, or a Needle ſo ſtick in a part, that they cannot be taken out, without great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> and large inciſion of the part, it is beſt to have recourſe to Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I ſaw one who carried a Thorn, which run into his Leg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Tibia,</hi> between the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſteum</hi> and the Skin, (when he thruſt through a Hedge in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) five years. The Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have a faculty of drawing out thoſe Bodies, which of their own Nature are extraneous, are of two ſorts: for they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Simple or Compound.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſimple Medicaments, they are of three ſorts: for ſome effect this by an hidden or occult faculty: Of ſuch <hi>Paulus Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 52. writes thus: <hi>Pieces of Weapons, Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Other Medicaments extract ſuch Bodies by an accidental heat pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Putrefaction, as Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, ſtinking old Pigeons durg, Leaven, and ſuch like.</p>

                        <hi>Cornelius Schylander,</hi> a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in his Practice of Chirurgery, publiſhed <hi>anno Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> 1577. <hi>De vulnerib. lect. quintà,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>If by reaſon of the Veins, Arteries and Nerves, the Wound will not admit any dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then we are to uſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which digeſt, relax and draw; or Charms,</hi> which he calls <hi>Verba Conſtellata,</hi> by which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that all ſorts of Weapons may eaſily be drawn out with the Fore-finger and the Thumb.

                     <p>Having then ſet down how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Bodies, which ſtick in Wounds, and hinder Unition, are drawn out by Medicaments, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that I acquaint you with the extraction of them by the help of Inſtruments. In this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration I will ſet down theſe two Points.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſhall be of the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may cauſe you to go about the drawing of theſe Bodies out of a Wound.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſhall be of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances remarkable in the drawing of them out.</p>
                     <p>The Occaſions are three. Firſt, if the Weapon may eaſily be drawn out. Secondly, if we fear Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemation, which may corrupt the wounded part. Thirdly, if we fear the Weapon to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
                     <p>The Circumſtances are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: for ſome are to be noted before you go about the Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Bodies, and ſome are to be obſerved in the Extraction it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Circumſtances which are to be noted before the Extraction are in number four.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mark the form of that Body which is to be drawn out.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, that he obſerve how deeply the Weapon hath pierced.</p>
                     <p>The third is, that the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a good Anatomiſt, and know the frame of the part; for ſo he ſhall be able to know which way Weapons, or ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Bodies, are to be drawn out.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, the Symptoms of the part wounded, are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as well thoſe which are to enſue, as thoſe which are preſent: as for Example, if the wounded party find great pain, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Body is without delay to be drawn out. But if a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Flux of Blood muſt enſue after the Extraction, it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                     <p>In the Extraction of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Bodies four things are to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, when it is moſt fit to remove theſe Bodies?</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, by what way they are to be taken out?</p>
                     <p>The third is, the Figure of theſe things which are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, by what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they are to be drawn out? I will diſcourſe briefly of all theſe in order.</p>
                     <p>As for the time fit for Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the pain be intolerable, the Weapon is preſently to be taken out, although we muſt not add pain to pain; for this being done, all pain will ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt not defer the Extraction, if the Weapon be poiſoned, or cankered, although we muſt divide the Muſcles, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Nerves: for we are to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52816:138"/>have a greater care of the whole, that it miſcarry not, than of a part. Neither need we fear the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Cautery: for Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes Poiſon, and takes away all fear of a Convulſion: How you may conjecture the Weapon to be poiſoned, I will amply and plainly declare in the proper place. In five Caſes you are to delay the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Weapon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if there be a fear of a great Flux of Blood, which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the life of the wounded party: This doth fall out, if the Wound be inflicted, where great Veins and Arteries are placed by Nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if fearful Symptoms, as horrible pain, a Convulſion, a ſharp Fever, or a <hi>Syncope,</hi> are like to enſue.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the Weapon be round, we may more ſecurely leave it in a Wound, than if it were flat: for the edges of it will cauſe pain of a receſſity, whereas the other will not procure a pain ſo great.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the Orifice of the Wound be made narrow by an Inflammation or a Tumor, we are to defer the Extraction of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, until thoſe Accidents be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: otherwiſe we ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Patient, and procure f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oonings, and a Fever, and it may be a gangrene or ſideration of the part.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, let us not attempt the Extraction of any Weapon, or part thereof, unleſs we have at land a ſit and convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: Otherwiſe we ſhall vex the wounded party, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ny fruit, and make him the more unwilling to ſuffer, when we are better prepared for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved in the Extraction of theſe Bodies, is the way by which they are to be drawn out. In three Caſes the Weapon may be thruſt out the contrary way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if it be almoſt through, but chiefly towards the depending part: for ſo leſs pain will be cauſed, and the Quittour will more promptly flow from the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Figure of the Weapon will not ſuffer it to be drawn out the ſame way, by which it was ſent in, as appears in barbed Arrows.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if there be no fear of cutting great Veſſels, or Nerves, In other Caſes we are to draw out the Weapons the ſame way they went in.</p>
                     <p>But you may demand of me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſafeſt to draw them out whole, or by piece-meal.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that all things brittle which ſtick in a Wound, as Glaſs, and Bones, are to be drawn out whole, if it may conveniently be done: But if they cannot be pulled out whole, but with pain and fear of Symptoms to enſue, they are to be broken, and then taken out. As for Weapons, which cannot be broken, and are like in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction to procure ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as barbed Arrows, you are to take them out with ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument as is able to deſend the wounded parts from harm; Of which I will ſpeak by and by.</p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:52816:139"/>
                     <p>The third thing which I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to obſerve in the Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtrange Bodies, was their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: for the Obſervation of this Point is requiſite: Becauſe the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure oftentimes makes the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more eaſie or difficult, as has been exemplified in a round and flat Weapon.</p>
                     <p>Now the fourth thing obſervable in Extraction of extraneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies was by me ſaid to be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Inſtruments. Of them I could make ſeveral Treatiſes; but I mean not ſo to miſpend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time. Neceſſity and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation invented them at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when Man being enraged by the Inſtigation of the Devil, and the Perturbations of his own Mind, not contented with his own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which Nature had granted him for offence and defence, found out a mean, compendiouſly to ſend his Brother (the Image of God) to dwell with <hi>Pluto</hi> for all eternity, and to be eſtranged from his Creator. O that we could pack up injuries for the preſent, untill the Day of Judgment, the great Aſſiſes come! Then we ſhould ſee a number of injured perſons ſufficiently avenged of their Oppreſſors (whom we ſhall ſee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to Eternal Torments) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bid Patience farewel, and would by entertaining Revenge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Judges of their own Cauſes, and deny God the Trial and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Many Inſtruments uſed in our Fore-fathers time, are become now out of uſe. Man in every Age doth deviſe new Inſtruments of Death. A <hi>Compendium</hi> we have in our Age, <hi>Gun-ſhot,</hi> the imitation of God's Thunder; but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is more fierce, and ſends more Souls to the Devil, than the Pattern: Of Inſtruments, I will but only point at a few, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, referring the reſt to the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of judicious Chirurgeons, which ſhall be employed in Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you muſt have a <hi>Blant book</hi> to lift up a Vein, Artery or Nerve, when a Bullet or Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is to be taken out of a Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you muſt have a pair or two of <hi>Forceps,</hi> hollow, ſtrong, and of good Steel, to lay hold on barbed Arrows, or ſuch Weapons as may hurt the parts, as they are drawn out.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gooſe-bills</hi> round and hollow at the points, double and ſingle, to take out Bullets in like manner.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Ravens-bill,</hi> ſtrong to ſqueeſe and take out Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, Bones, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the <hi>Forcipes inciſorii,</hi> which cut being dilated on each ſide: Theſe muſt be of good Steel, well tempered, and very ſharp Some which are ſold in the Shops, are worth nothing. Theſe may have uſe, when a Wound is to be inciſed, to draw out of it any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous thing.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the ſecond and third Duty, which the Phyſician or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon (called to cure a Wound) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>e brevity and perſpicuity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you the third and fourth Duty, which belongs to a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>geon or Phyſician, Natures friends, in aſſiſting her in preſerving her ſelf, and labouring to ſhun wrongs offered by her adverſary, which hath done the beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her overthrow and diſſolution, by disjoyning parts united. Theſe Duties are two; to wit, that the Phyſician and Chirurgeon firſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preſerve the natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the part wounded: And ſecondly, that he labour to reſtore it if it be loſt.</p>
                     <p>The natural temperature of the Body, is preſerved by two means. The firſt is, the right ordering of thoſe things which are called <hi>not natural:</hi> The ſecond is the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of convenient Medicaments. But before I go about to deliver unto you the means, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the natural Conſtitution of the part wounded not being altered, or how it is to be reſtored when it is loſt; I muſt deſcribe unto you the natural Conſtitution, that knowing it aright, you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, uſing it as a Rule to ſee, as it were in a Glaſs, the defects which have ſeized upon Nature, and the degree of their declination from that which is <hi>ſecundum naturam,</hi> or according to Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now the natural temperature of the part is <hi>Naturalis ejus ſiccitas,</hi> or the convenient ſiccity or drineſs of it. So much we may collect out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who in that Treatiſe which he hath left to us, <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceribus,</hi> or of Ulcers, affirms that <hi>ſiccum eſt ſano proximum,</hi> that is, that which is dry comes near to that which is whole. In your practice by obſervation, you have learned to prognoſticate to your ſelves health to every Patient having either Ulcer or Wound, when you ſee ſmall ſtore of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52816:140"/>laudable Quittour to flow from the Sore.</p>
                     <p>But you may doubt, and not without cauſe, why <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did aſcribe the natural tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body to drineſs, a <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> quality, and not to heat or coldneſs, which are <hi>active</hi> quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that this cauſe moved him to think ſo; becauſe if the natural ſiccity or drineſs of the part doth continue unviolate, the natural degrees of heat and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are preſerved in the Body; But on the contrary you have obſerved, that if in the part wounded, by reaſon of pain, ſuperfluous Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity be attracted, and extraneous heat be increaſed, that the natural heat oftentimes is corrupted, and corruption of the part enſues; or elſe that it being more than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat can rule and diſſipate, doth cauſe a <hi>Schirrhus</hi> of the part, either wounded or ulcerated; for ſo you ſee, if the natural drineſs of the part wounded be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that neither the natural heat is corrupted, nor the natural cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is increaſed.</p>
                     <p>When I ſpeak of natural cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would not have you to think that I ſpeak of an abſolute cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which quite extinguiſhes the natural heat, and cauſes ſideration or death of the part: but of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative coldneſs found in ſome parts, which is ſo great in them, that if it be compared with the heat of other parts, it may ſeem a privation of heat, thô not perfect. Such are the ſpermatick parts, if they be compared with the fleſhy, and amongſt thoſe the Bones, if they be compared with the Muſcles, your Senſes will teach you ſo much. Having ſpoken thus much of what is meant by the terms of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temperature of a part wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is needful for a Chirurgeon to know; I muſt labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which I promiſed in the beginning of the Chapter, and that was the ſetting down of the means by which it is preſerved. I affirmed them to be two; to wit, the right ordering of things not natural, and the convenient uſe of local Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the firſt point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe documents. Seeing then a ſpecial care is to be had of the Air, Diet, Evacuation, Reſt, and Exerciſe, Watching and Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and laſt of all; of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or perturbations of the Mind, which he that is dangerouſly wounded is to obſerve, if he be preſented to you to be cured; I will briefly ſet down how every one of theſe is to be ordered.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Air: That Air which is temperate, and ſo proportionate to the temperature of the parts of the Body, is moſt fit for wounded parts: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome require both a hotter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Air, and warmer applications than others do. Will you know which theſe parts be? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhall reſolve you, <hi>Aphor. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 18. in whom theſe words are found: <hi>Cold is an enemy to the Bones, Teeth, Nerves, Brain, the ſpinal Marrow; but heat is pleaſing to theſe.</hi> Heat principally delights the Joints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe naturally they are cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing framed onely of ſpermatick, parts, as Tendons, Membranes, Ligaments, Cartilages, and Bones,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52816:140"/>and that as well in the Summer as in the Winter. A temperate Air is moſt convenient for other parts.</p>
                     <p>If any parts may endure cold, theſe are the Ventricles, according to <hi>Hippec. lib. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceribus:</hi> for the confirmation of this his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two reaſons may be yielded.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, external Cold increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the natural heat, by keeping it in, by ſealing up the Pores, by which it might breath out; and ſo it cauſes the better concoction, and makes them more able to expel all Excrements; but immoderate heat eliquates or melts the Humors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an unnatural heat, which diſſipates the natural heat, and ſo makes the Ventricles unapt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coute their Functions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the Ventricles there are great veſſels, that contain plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood and Spirits, which are able to reſiſt any cold impreſſion. In the Breaſt you have the <hi>Vena cava</hi> aſcending, the <hi>Vena arterialis,</hi> the <hi>Arteria venalis,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta.</hi> In the lower Ventricle you have the meſaraical Veins, the <hi>Vena portae,</hi> the radication of the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> deſcending. What I have ſpoken of the Air, I would have to be underſtood of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons Hand, the Medicaments, and Linnens which are to be uſed about the dreſſing of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party. If the ſeaſon of the year afford not unto you an Air anſwerable to your deſire, you are to procure it by Art.</p>
                     <p>Now it follows that I appoint a convenient Diet for perſons wounded: As concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, receive theſe Aphoriſms. Firſt, in great and freſh wounds, and in ſuch as threaten an Inflammation, which happens moſt uſually if the Body be Plethorick, a ſlender Diet is to be preſcribed. Secondly, in wounds of the Ventricles and Joints, and in thoſe which have been ſtitched, the like Diet is to be uſed. Two Queſtions here may be moved.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, what <hi>Victus tenuis</hi> or a ſlender Diet is?</p>
                     <p>The Second is, How long this Diet is to be continued?</p>
                     <p>A ſlender Diet is that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords but little nouriſhment, and cools; for ſuch a Diet is moſt fit for contemperating the heat of the Humors, and ſtaying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This Diet is to be continued until the Seventh day be paſt, which is the firſt critical day in ſharp diſeaſes. Then the uſe of Wine, Fleſh, and Eggs is to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Let the wounded party take thin Broths altered with Lettuce, Spinage, Purſlain, Endive, Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the common and Wood-Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, adding the emulſion of the ſeeds of Musk-melon, Pompion and Cucumber. Thin Panadoes, and Oatmeal gruels are fit. Sallets of the aforenamed Herbs, boiled and dreſſed with Vinegar and ſweet Butter, may be permitted: Apples and Pears, either roaſted or baked, cold, may be granted. Let the Drink be ſmall Beer or Ale to thoſe who have uſed them in their health: But if you have in cure one, who cannot abide this Liquor; then you are to appoint for him Water boiled with the bottom of a Wheaten-loaf ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Oxyſaccharum,</hi> or the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Endive, Succory ſimple, or

                        </gap> accidents, you may grant poched Eggs, ſo that the wounded party eat as well the White as the Yolk. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewed unto you what Air and Diet are moſt convenient for wounded perſons, I am in like manner to talk of Evacuation. Of it there be two kinds, Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and purgation by ſiege. As for Phlebotomy, the end of it is to procure ſiccitle, or drineſs to the wounded parts, according to <hi>Celſ. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. Whether Phlebotomie be to be uſed or no, theſe things following will ſhew you: The wound it ſelf, the habit of the whole Body, the paſſions of the Mind, and the Air it ſelf: From the wound it ſelf, in this operation receive theſe Canons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in great Wounds from whence ſmall ſtore of Blood hath iſſued, and when weak parts are wounded, as the Joints (whither ſuperfluous Humors may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Phlebotomy is neceſſary. The reaſon of the firſt part of the Canon is this: If the Wound hath bled but little, the part not being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently dried, Fluxion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation may be cauſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If in a Wound, either deep or many ſtitches have been taken, a Vein is to be opened: for the pain which is cauſed by reaſon of the ſtitching, is like to procure attraction of Humors, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in Wounds wherein there is no great pain, and in which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deep nor any ſtitches have been taken, you may ſpare Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in Wounds of the fleſhy parts which are ſtrong, as alſo in thoſe parts unto which a Humor can hardly be carried, as in the hairy Scalp and Face, you may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from blood-letting.</p>
                     <p>As for the habit of the Body, take this Aphoriſm: if the Body be Plethorick and Feveriſh, if Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler abound, boldly open a Vein; but not ſo, if the party be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick; for this Humor can neither be ſo eaſily inflamed, nor flow, to cauſe any Inflammation. You are in like manner to note the paſſions of the Mind. If the party wounded be furious and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, if he ſleep not well, if the Spirits be extraordinarily moved, open a Vein; but if the wounded party be of a dejected Spirit and fearful, and be but little moved, you may ſpare Blood-letting.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, you are to obſerve the conſtitution of the Air: in hot weather then you may more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe Phlebotomy than in cold; and ſo rather in the Summer ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than in the Winter; for in hot weather the Humors are h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and thinner than in cold, and ſo more apt to flow to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part.</p>
                     <p>As for purgation by Stool, it is appointed for ſtaying of Humors from flowing to the part wounded. But ſeeing the ſymptomes which ariſe by reaſon of a Fluxion, are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52816:141"/>moſt commonly two, a <hi>Phlegmone</hi> or <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> it is evident that thoſe purgative Medicaments which evacuate Choler, called <hi>cholagoga</hi> are moſt fit: ſuch are <hi>manna,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinds, <hi>caſſia,</hi> Syrup of Roſes and Violets ſolutive, <hi>Electuarium lemtivum, elect. de ſucco roſarum, Dicatholicum, Diaprunum, &amp;c.</hi> In five eaſes ſuch Medicaments are to be miniſtred: Firſt, in wounds of the Ventricles. Secondly, in wounds of the Joints. Thirdly, if the part wounded be troubled with an Inflammation, or <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</hi> Fourthly, if the wounded part hath been ſtitched. Fifthly, if either inciſion, dilatation, or raſping of the Bone have been uſed.</p>
                     <p>As for Reſt and Motion, receive theſe admonitions: Firſt, as in wounds of the lower Limbs, it is ill to walk or to ſtand; ſo in wounds of the upper Limbs, it is hurtful to exerciſe them. Secondly, if either the ſuperior or the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts receive a great Wound, it is good to keep the party in Bed: but let the wounded party be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that poſture, as is like to afford greateſt eaſe. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: If the Hand or Foot be wounded, let them be placed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what high, to hinder flowing of Humors to them. If the member muſt be kept unmoveable, the uſe of it will ſhew the beſt ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for ſome parts muſt be kept bended, as the Elbow and Fingers: but others muſt be extended, as the Knee and Foot: and from hence ſprung this obſervation, <hi>Cubitus ad collum, crus ad lectum,</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is to be tyed to the Neck, but the Foot to the Bed.</p>
                     <p>As for Watching and Sleeping, ſeeing Watching dries the Body, as Sleep moiſtens it, according to <hi>Hippoc. Aphor.</hi> it is not good for the wounded party to take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſleep, in two caſes: Firſt, if we fear that Humors will flow to the part wounded, which we may conjecture they may do in plethorick Bodies. Secondly, if a wound fall out to be in a Joint; for Sleep cools the Joints: but if the pain be great, then it is good to ſuffer the wounded perſon to ſleep; yea, to procure it by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne means, inwardly miniſtred, and outwardly applyed, if you ſee Nature of her ſelf inclined to ſleep; for ſo the Spirits being retired into the center, the faculty is at reſt, and ſo the pain is eaſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all I will conclude by ſpeaking but ſparingly of the Mind: we muſt labour to remove all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of the paſſions of the Mind from thoſe who are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore no ill tidings are to be brought to thoſe, who are come to the years of diſcretion, and Children by all means are to be kept from crying and weeping.</p>
                     <p>Above all other things, let <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> be abandoned: for it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hinders Conſolidation: for by it the Blood and Spirits are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and by motion noxious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors flow to the part: There are few Artiſts who have not by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Patients obſerved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of this action.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the fifth and ſixth Duties belonging to a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in curing a Wound.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter I ſhewed you as briefly and plainly as I could, how the natural Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a wounded part is to be preſerved by the right ordering of thoſe things which are called <hi>Non naturales,</hi> or not natural. Now I am to ſhew you how this ſame is to be effected by the application of local Medicaments: for in <hi>Plethorick</hi> or <hi>Cacochymical</hi> Bodies, all means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed according to Art, will ſometimes, but with difficulty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
                     <p>Seeing, as I ſhewed you, that the natural Temperature of the part is nothing elſe but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>ſiceitie</hi> or drineſs of it: It is out of all controverſie, that the Medicaments which are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to wounded parts, ought to be <hi>ſiccantia</hi> or drying.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing there are ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of drying Medicaments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on may demand of me, in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of drineſs thoſe Medicaments ought to be, which are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to wounded parts?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that both the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the whole Body, and of the part affected, will declare this unto you. One thing is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Medicament which is to be applied to a wounded part, ought ever to be ſomewhat driet than the part it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for example, if the Cheek of a Boy or Girl be wounded, you are to apply Medicaments which are drie in the firſt degree, at St. <hi>John</hi>'s-wort, Avens, Chamae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Melilot, Saffron, Barley and Bean-meal: But if a Boy be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Joint, or Nerve, you are to apply ſuch things as are dry in the Second degree. If theſe things happen to an aged perſon, or a ſtrong clown; then you are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch Topicks as are drie in the Third degree. Wherefore in ſeft parts wounded, as in the bellies of Muſcles, and fleſhy parts, a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament is to be applied, which is of the ſtrongeſt in the Firſt degree. In parts which are hard, as in the Tendons, or Cartilages wounded, you are to apply to the parts wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Medicaments as are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt drying in the Third degree. But to parts wounded, which are of a mean Temperature, neither too ſoft nor too hard, you are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52816:142"/>for Medicaments the ſtrongeſt Deficcatives in the Second degree.</p>
                     <p>From what has been ſaid you may gather, that neither Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor Oil, are fit to be applied to wounds: becauſe both do moiſten and relax too much. Beſides this, if cold Spring-water be applied, it may procure a Gangrene by too much refrigerating the part, and quenching the natural heat. Let me warn you of one thing, that theſe deſiccative Medicaments muſt have a moderate aſtriction: for ſo the Blood being ingroſſed, more ſhall fot flow to the part than is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the nutrition of it. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have made mention of ſuch ſimples as are fit to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Wounds, to procure their unition, you will expect (no doubt) Thrief enumeration of ſuch as are accounted the moſt effectual. I kill only name them, leaying their deſcription and other effects, to be gathered out of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch as have publiſhed Herbals, and have diſcourſed of Animals or living Creatures, and Minerals, from whence theſe means are fetched.</p>
                     <p>If you are deſirous to know the nature of Plants, have recourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancients to <hi>Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> who was a ſtipendiary Soldier under <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who was overcome by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in Fight by Sea at <hi>Actium</hi> the <hi>Promontory,</hi> about 42 years before the birth of Chriſt. As concerning Minerals, <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath left a Treatiſe of them, who hath delivered ſo much of them as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Chirurgeon to know: If you have a mind to know what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>fiety of living Creatures there be, peruſe the Monuments of <hi>Conradus Geſnerus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes Aldrovandus,</hi> and <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> who have written of theſe Subjects. The Simples then which are moſt effectual for the conſolidation of Wounds, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either from Vegetables, Animals, or Minerals. As for thoſe which are taken from Vegetables, I commend unto you theſe; St. <hi>John</hi>'s wort, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s wort, Betonie, Agrimony, Birthwort, Vervein, both ſorts of Avens, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate-flowers, Horſe-tail, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Knot-graſs, Milfoil, <hi>Lunaria</hi> the greater and leſſer, Shepherds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe, Perwincle, Larks-heel, both the Centauries (but the greater is more effectual) Dittanie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, Ladies-mantle, Self-heal, Clowns All-heal, <hi>Serpentaria,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-tongue, Looſe-ſtrife, Hore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, Myrtil, Red Roſe, Myrrhe, Maſtick, <hi>Elemi, Olibanum,</hi> Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Seal, Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Pitch, Roſin, Willow, Rue, Sarcocol, Borax, Ladies-Torch, Birdlime, wild baſtard Saffron, <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> and Tobacco. Of theſe Simples taking the Juices and the Herbs ſtamped, you may make Balſams; and if you add Swines-greaſe, Wax, Roſin, and <hi>Gummt Elemi,</hi> you may make Unguents effectual for the cure of Wounds.</p>
                     <p>Living creatures put to their helping hands: of them you have <hi>Mummia,</hi> Earth-worms, Snails, the fat of a Horſe, Sheeps Suet, Swines Greaſe, Deers Suet, Goats Greaſe, the extract of Mans Blood, the Spiders web, Bones burned to white aſhes, and Harts-horns cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined; if they be brought to an impalpable Powder, being grownd
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52816:143"/>upon a Painters ſtone, and made up into the form of Trochiſces, with the diſtill'd water of Snails, and then being beat to powder, and mingled with <hi>

                     <p>The Minerals alſo are no nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards in this caſe. The Litharges preſent themſelves firſt, without which hardly can any Emplaſter be brought to a laudable conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That which is called Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge of Gold, affords a brighter colour to Emplaſters, than that of Silver: yet the effect is all one. Copper affords <hi>Aes uſtum, Squam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma aeris,</hi> and <hi>Aes viride,</hi> all very uſeful in the practice of Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Jupiter</hi> or Tin, yields his flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by ſublimation, or if he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a convenient Liquor, Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals: which being dulcified and brought to Powder, and mingled in a due proportion with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Unguents or Emplaſters, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceedingly the healing of Wounds and Ulcers. <hi>Mars</hi> or Iron affords unto us his <hi>Crocus,</hi> as 'tis termed: How powerful it is not only to haſten Conſolidation of ſolution of Unity; but in looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>Gonorrhaeas</hi> and other diſeaſes alſo, there is none ignorant, who hath had but a reaſonable practice in Phyſick or Chirurgery. What ſhall I ſpeak of <hi>Minium,</hi> both the Corals, <hi>Tutia, Calaminaris,</hi> and the Load-ſtone. By the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe few means taken from Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, for the curing of Wounds, you may perceive how bountiful Nature is to Mankind in ſupplying his wants. O that he were not wanting or deficient to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we would take pains only to prepare thoſe things, whereof Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath left us no ſmall ſtore, and judiciouſly according to the preſcript of Art apply them, we ſhould find in our practice a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs than ſundry times falls out: Neither ſhould we have need to blame the irregularity of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and the ill correſpondence of thoſe things, which are called <hi>Non naturales,</hi> or not natural. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thinks that he may without any ſtop or ſtay, go through the curing of all wounded perſons, in what part ſoever the Wound is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, with the ordinary Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, carried about in Salvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he deceives himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe for the preſent uſe muſt be in a readineſs; but if he find theſe after application not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his expectation, he muſt have recourſe to others. Which Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantents are ſitteſt, the collation of the part wounded, and the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks will ſhew, as I have told you before.</p>
                     <p>Having delivered unto you, how the temperature of the part is to be preſerved by the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things, which are called <hi>Non naturales,</hi> or not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as Air, Meat, and Drink, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation and Retention, Sleeping and Watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo by the application of fit Topicks to the part, you may require according to my promiſe, how the natural temperature, if it be altered, may be reduced to its own tenor again? Let me tell you, that by the ſame means, it is to be reduced, by the which it is preſerved. Only this is to be obſerved, that the means
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52816:143"/>which cure, muſt be more forcible, and more intended in their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than thoſe are, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to maintain the natural Temperature.</p>
                     <p>As for example, if a wound prove very moiſt, and ſend out much Quittour, you muſt labour ſtrongly to drie the habit of the Body, by Bleeding, Purging, a ſlender Diet, Watching, and ſuch like, and by applying to the wounded part Medicaments, which ſtrongly dry, and are endued with a certain aſtriction. If other elementary qualities, as heat, cold, drineſs appear, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by their contraries, but intended in their qualities above that degree which was ſufficient to maintain the natural Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tature of the part wounded.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſixth Duty, which I affirmed to be required of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician or Chirurgeon, when he is called to cure a wounded perſon, was the obſervation of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which flow from the wound, and their true and natural cauſes: I will deliver firſt unto you the diverſity of Excrements or Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, which a wounded part ſends out, and then I will ſhew unto you the cauſes of them.</p>
                     <p>The Excrements which flow out of a Wound, are in number three; <hi>liber, Sordes, Pus: Ichor</hi> is a thin Excrement. The cauſe of it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. Of it there are two kinds: for either it is an Excrement, iſſuing from the Veins themſelves or elſe it proceeds from the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part: If it iſſue from the Veins, then it is a wateriſh and thin Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, flowing from the capillary Veins not altered, and without my noiſome ſmell, by its colour ſhewing which of the four Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours has dominion in the maſs of Blood. Wherefore if the Blood be very pure, it has a certain bright redneſs repreſenting Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fleſh has been waſhed. If yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Choler be predominant, then the <hi>Ichor</hi> is of a bright yellowiſh colour: If Phlegm abound, then the <hi>Ichor</hi> is whitiſh: if Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpaſs, then the <hi>Ichor</hi> or thin Humidity is of a darkiſh ſwarth colour. If this thin Humidity ſpring from the part wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is altered and corrupted by the part which ſends it out, it has an unpleaſant ſmell, being an Excrement of the part. As the firſt kind of <hi>Ichor</hi> is called <hi>ſerum Sanguinis,</hi> the wateriſhneſs of the Blood, which is mingled with the Blood, that ſo being made more fluxible, it may the more eaſily be diſtributed to the habit of the Body, to nouriſh it; ſo the <hi>Ichor</hi> which is an Excrement of the wounded part, is called <hi>Sanies</hi> and <hi>Virus,</hi> and according to the degree of the corruption of the part, it is more or leſs ſtinking. If it flow from a part poſſeſſed with a Cancer, it is wonderful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign and ſtinking: If it iſſue out of a part ſiderate or mortified by reaſon of a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> it is cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous. By the exhalation which is breathed out of the pores of the Skin, raiſed from the <hi>ſerum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis</hi> by the natural heat, Dogs find out their Maſters, and will conſtantly hunt after that game, which they are firſt ſet about: This be wrays the complexion of the <hi>Individuum;</hi> but <hi>Sanies</hi> and <hi>Virus</hi> ſhew the corruption of the part.</p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:52816:144"/>
                     <p>The Second kind of Excrement is called <hi>Sordes:</hi> This is a compact and viſcous Excrement, ſo cleaving to the wounded parts, that it will not be removed without the uſe of a firm inſtrument: for lint upon a probe will not bring it away.</p>
                     <p>Of this thickneſs three cauſes may be aſſigned: the Firſt is the drie conſtitution, both of the whole Body, and the wounded part alſo: the Second cauſe may be the error of the Chirurgeon, who hath applied too drying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments to the affected part: the Third cauſe may be the cold Air, which having been let into the Wound, by the careleſneſs of the dreſſer of it, hath condenſed, and thickned the <hi>Pus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third Excrement which wounded parts fend forth is called <hi>Pus.</hi> This is an Excrement white, ſmooth and equal or uniform, without any grumous or knotty ſubſtance, having no ill ſinell, not ſo liquid as <hi>Sanies,</hi> nor ſo thick and viſcous as <hi>Sordes.</hi> See <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates lib. de Praedictionibus. Galen.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Glaucon.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>Method.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to the cauſes of the Excrements which are ſent forth from Wounds, which was the Second point propounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Excrements, note theſe Aphoriſms. Firſt, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe three Excrements are either the efficient or material cauſes. Secondly, the efficient cauſes are two, the natural and unnatural heat. Thirdly, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, whereby a laudable <hi>Put</hi> is engendred: but the unnatural heat working upon Humidity, cauſes putrefaction, and an evil ſmell. Fourthly, the material cauſes are two, to wit, contuſed Fleſh, which by digeſtives muſt be turned to Quittour, and a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which moſt commonly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizes with the complexion of the party wounded, whether it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or accidental. If then the natural conſtitution of the party wounded be good, the <hi>Pus</hi> is lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but if by reaſon of errors committed in the uſe of thoſe things which are called Not Natural, in the courſe of life a ſickly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion be acquired: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if one become Hydropick, Pocky, or Leprous; then the Wound is like to caſt out no good Excrements; but either <hi>Sanies, Virus,</hi> or <hi>Sordes.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the common Symptomes of Wounds.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AT laſt I am come to the laſt general Duty, which the Chirurgeon is to diſcharge to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in aſſiſting her, in joyning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined parts procured by a Wound, and that is the Seventh Duty in number, as I ſet down in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter concerning this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Wounds. This I affirmed to be the removing of ſome <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accidents</hi> which enſue, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes invade the wounded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after that a Wound is inflicted: Now theſe are in number two; Pain, and Swooning, or fainting; I call them general, becauſe they may accompany all forts of Wounds as well Simple as Compound. As for Pain, no Wound can be inflicted without cauſing ſome pain, either more or leſs: This is certain, in all compound Wounds, and agree'd upon by the unanimous conſent of all Authors who have left Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of this Subject to poſterity: beſides this, ſeeing the Skin at the leaſt muſt be divided in ſimple Wounds, who can imagine this can be done without pain, ſeeing the Skin is the inſtrument of touching and feeling? As for Fainting and Swooning, it alſo often falls out in both Simple and Compound Wounds: And in Simple Wounds daily obſervation doth evince this to be moſt true. Scarce an Artiſt hath been employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Blood-letting, who has been ſo careful and Fortunate in performing the Operation, but that he has had ſundry who have fainted under his Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any remarkable ſtore of Blood hath been drawn. Now what Wound can be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more ſimple, than that which is made with the Lancet or Flegm, which will be united within the ſpace of a few hours after that the Vein is ſhut and bound up? It fell out once that I ſate at the Table with ſundry Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, amongſt whom there was one noted for his Valour; he having but lightly cut his Finger, and by the advice of one, who ſate next unto him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a little Salt to the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, with his knife, preſently ſunk down from the Table, and was carried away.</p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:52816:145"/>
                     <p>Of theſe two Accidents, I will firſt diſcourſe of Pain, becauſe it extends it ſelf farther than Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Swooning do; for no Wound, whether it be Simple or Compound, can be without more or leſs pain, when it is firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, for the reaſon which I yielded a little before. Whereas ſundry have received grievous Wounds, and yet have not fainted; for it muſt be not a ſmall matter, which will cauſe a ſtout or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Perſon to faint: Beſides this, pain very often is the cauſe of fainting; now the cauſe by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath the priority of the effect. Pain then in Latin is called <hi>dolor,</hi> which is deduced from the Verb <hi>doleo,</hi> which ſignifieth to grieve or to feel pain. Firſt, I wil deſcribe unto you what pain is; Secondly, how this Accident is removed from the wounded party, as by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of convenient local means, which moſt properly is the Office of a Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p>Pain is deſcribed by <hi>Galen</hi> to be <hi>triſtis ſenſatio,</hi> a grievous feeling; this deſcription of <hi>Galen</hi> rather ſhews how Pain is cauſed, than what it is; for Pain is procured by ſome offending Object, moving the Inſtrument of Touch: And in truth we muſt acknowledge, that Pain is not the feeling it ſelf ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> did not call Pain feeling abſolutely, but feeling with a grief. In Pain two things are to be noted: Firſt, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſenſible Object, as it is ſenſible: The ſecond is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the ſame, as it is pleaſing or unpleaſant. If we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquire in which of theſe two the nature of Pain doth ſubſiſt; we muſt confeſs, that Dolour or Pain is not the very apprehenſion of the ſenſible Object, but the Grief which is cauſed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the unpleaſant ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object, and the corruption of the Organ. Wherefore, Pain may thus fitly be deſcribed; It is <hi>a grievouſneſs, which is felt in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Senſe of Touching, cauſed by thoſe things which make a Solution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this deſcription, three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Logick are to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The firſt the <hi>Genus,</hi> which is ſaid to be <hi>moleſtia,</hi> or grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for there are Griefs as well of the Mind as of the Body; as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy at the Proſperity of another, which is Diabolical; and raſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which is Beſtial: but Pain is a Grief of the Body. The ſecond Argument is the <hi>Subject</hi> wherein Pain is ſeated, and that is the <hi>Organ of Touch.</hi> The <hi>Cauſes</hi> make up the third Argument; and thoſe are thought to be ſuch things as <hi>cauſe Solution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Inſtrument.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here a Queſtion may be moved, whether Pain may not be felt in the Inſtruments of other Senſes, as the Hearing, Seeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the Inſtrument of Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, that two kinds of troubleſomeneſs may be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in every Senſe, beſides Touching. The one is, when the Inſtrument of Touching it ſelf is offended, which is imparted unto all the reſt of the Senſes: The other is, when the proper Senſe it ſelf is offended; as when a Scholar meditates and is hindred by the ringing of Bells; or when one
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52816:145"/>having compoſed himſelf to ſleep, it troubled with the unpleaſant howling of Dogs, noiſes of Carts and Coaches, and clamors of Drunkards, which is frequent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough here in <hi>London,</hi> where the Hearing is offended; or when one with grief and commiſeration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his dear Friend extinguiſhed with an Apoplexy, who ſat with him at Table immediately before his fall, which hath been often ſeen, where the Senſe of Seeing is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. But there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the pain in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or Touch, and theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of the other Senſes: The firſt truly deſerves the name of Pain; but the ſecond may be termed averſations or diſlikings of the Objects, rather than Pains. This moved <hi>Galen</hi> to ſay, 1. <hi>deſympt. cauſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Delight and Grief hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all the Senſes, but not with the like evidence.</hi> But as concerning Pain, which offends the Inſtruments of Feeling, thus he writes, <hi>de different. ſympt. c.</hi> 3. <hi>The Senſe of Touching, above all other Senſes, hath obtained a moſt remarkable Symptom, to wit, Pain in its Action.</hi> And tho other Senſes may feel Grief, yet this Grief only proceeds from their external proper Objects; but Pain may happen unto the Senſe of Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only from external, but from internal affections alſo reſting within the Body, which ſometimes have been ſo vehement, that ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Perſons have diſpatched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I will not go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this laſt Point, affirmed by <hi>Galen,</hi> ſeeing I am to deliver Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgical Doctrine, and not Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Narrations. But who will give himſelf content, let him pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe and turn over the Volume of <hi>Schenkius</hi> his Obſervations, where he ſhall read Examples more than enough. Thus much I thought good to deliver concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pain, which is an Accident proper to the Organ of Touching: and although it be ſomewhat Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical; yet it cannot but be profitable for you, ſeeing it is able to enrich your Underſtandings, that you may be able to expreſs what is meant by Pain, when it is named, and to diſcern when it is a proper Symptom of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Feeling, and when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Inſtrument of Feeling it is communicated to other Senſes. It is now full time to ſet down ſuch topical Medicaments as are effectual to aſſwage Pain. Theſe Medicaments are of two kinds: for either they are Narcotical, or Anodyne. Anodyne Medicaments by the Grecians are called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and by others <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, aſſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Pain. Theſe Medicaments are temperate, anſwerable to the conſtitution of our Bodies: and therefore they maintain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and natural heat of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: By their pleaſant heat they gently open the Pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; by the ſubtilneſs of ſubſtance they enter into the pores, and make all the Humors uniform, they ſoften and looſen the part, and ſo it becomes leſs apt to receive Pain: And if they exceed in heat a little, they open the Pores more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and diſcuſs ſome of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt part of the peccant Humor, which is moſt fierce, and ſo abate ſomewhat the cauſe of the Pain, The Simples of this order are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52816:146"/>Chamaemil, Melilot, Dill, Elder, Wall-wort, ordinary Mallow, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow, Roots and Flowers of Lllies, Fenugreek, Linſeed, Barley, ſweet Sallet-Oyl, Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Mans-greaſe, Capons-greaſe, Swines-greaſe, Gooſe-greaſe, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without Salt, Marrows, Cream and ſweet Milk. Of theſe Oyls and Cataplaſms may be framed fit for your purpoſe. This parable Medicament I commend unto you, <hi>Reducatur <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum album Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuratum in formain linimenti Oleo Lil.

                     <p>Narcotical Medicaments neither take away the cauſe of Pain, nor aſſwage Pain; but ſtupefie the Part, that it cannot feel that which is painful: ſuch Medicaments are cold in the end of the third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in the fourth, which drive away the natural heat and ſpirits from the part. Of this ſort are water-Lily, Henbane, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, Deadly Night-ſhade, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drake, Apple of <hi>Peru,</hi> black Poppy and <hi>Opium,</hi> Darnel, and the Seeds of the former Simples, of which Simples you may make both Cataplaſms and Oyls.

                     <p>As for the Cauſes, receive theſe Aphoriſms. Firſt, a <hi>Syncope</hi> may happen when there is not Matter miniſtred for the generation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as in Famine. Secondly, it may happen, when the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart is altered by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome Diſeaſe, as in Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Fevers. Thirdly, when a malign Matter is communicated to the Heart, as it happens in a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortification of a Member. Fourthly, when the Spirits are ſpent, and diſſipated by too great Heat, Watching, Travel, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Evacuations. Fifthly, it may happen by Antipathy, ſo it hath been noted that ſome have ſwooned at the ſmell of a Roſe. Sixthly, Fear alſo may be the Cauſe. Seventhly, it happens when the Spirits are ſuffocated by crude Humors or Vapors. Eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may invade, when a malign Vapor is ſent from another part of the Body to the heart, as in Fits of the Mother. Ninthly, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52816:146"/>ſenſibleneſs of the part wounded may be the cauſe, as if it be a Joint, Nerve, Tendon, or Membrane.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a <hi>Syncope</hi> are theſe: Firſt, the Face grows Pale, the Pulſe is ſmall, ſlow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, a green or yellow colour is repreſented to the Sight, then the Sight becomes dim, the Hands and Feet become cold, Sweat breaks out about the Forehead, and at laſt the Pulſe altogether ceaſeth; Moving, Feeling and Speech are taken away, and the Body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es for a while, as if it were dead.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks, receive theſe: Firſt, if a man come not to himſelf again after that he is rubbed with Roſe Water or <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> hath Wine or ſtrong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters poured into his Mouth, and hath had ſtrong ſneeſing Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments blown up into his Noſe, the <hi>Syncope</hi> is accounted deadly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if a <hi>Syncope</hi> ſurpriſe one, who before was feeble and weak, it is dangerous. Thirdly, a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi> proceeding from an inward cauſe, is more dangerous than that which proceeds from an outward cauſe. Fourthly, a <hi>Syncope</hi> which proceeds from oppreſſion of the Spirits is more eaſily cured, than that which proceeds from the diſſipation of the ſame, by reaſon of inanition. Fifthly, they who often ſwoon without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe, at laſt die ſuddenly. <hi>Hipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sixthly, that <hi>Syncope</hi> which is a primary affection of the Heart is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than that which happens by the conſent of the other parts. Seventhly, when a <hi>Syncope</hi> happens by reaſon of immoderate evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood in Wounds, we have no cauſe to deſpair, chiefly if the wounded party be of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: for Blood by a good Diet is eaſily reſtored. Eighthly, when one comes to himſelf after Swooning, if the Pulſe and freſh Colour return not, he is like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to fall into it again. Ninthly, who goes not about to prevent a <hi>Syncope,</hi> when he ſees a <hi>Lypothomy</hi> to have poſſeſſed the wounded party, he is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted acceſſory to the death of him, according to ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutical Point of this Diſcourſe, expect not whatſoever may be ſaid of it: for many things delivered would be impertinent, no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Practice of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery: I therefore will acquaint you with thoſe means only, which your Duty requires. The curative means then are either External or Internal. As for the External, theſe which follow are accounted moſt effectual: Firſt, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Noſe are to be bedewed with Odoriferous Liquors. If the party be hot, apply ſuch as are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temperate or not very cold, as the Water of Orange Flowers, the Waters of Medow ſweet, Balm, Roſes, the ordinary ſweet Waters. If the party be cold, apply the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Balm, Mints, Wormwood or <hi>Angelica.</hi> If the party wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be a Woman, you are not to rub theſe parts with things Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous, leſt you bring on the Mother. To theſe then uſe the Spirit or Extract of <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> and Rue, which are excellent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, uſe ſhaking of the Body, frictions of the extremities, hard
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52816:147"/>preſſing the parts adjacent to the Joints of the lower Jaw under the Lobes of the Ears, ſhouting into the Ear, and calling upon the party by his own name, moiſtning of the Tongue with <hi>Theriaca An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachi</hi> diſſolved in Cinnamome Water, having added a few drops of the Oyl of Sage and Amber.

If it be a ſtrong <hi>Syncope,</hi> it will not be amiſs to pull hard the Hairs of the Temples and Neck.</p>
                     <p>As for the Internal means, a Sop in ſtrong Wine, as Aligant, Malmeſey, Canary Wine, or white Baſtard, is very good, ſo that the Wine be drunk together with the Toaſt. <hi>Confectio Alkermes</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Cinnamome Water, or Treacle diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis</hi> and miniſtred are effectual.

                     <p>IN the ſecond Chapter of this Subject of Wounds, I affirmed the laſt ſcope and end which a Chirurgeon propoſes to himſelf when he goes about the curing of a Wound, to be the reunition of the parts disjoyned by an external Inſtrument. I ſet down alſo the differences of Unition, which were <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>agglutination,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>concarnation:</hi> give me leave to uſe theſe terms to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Greek words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agglutination,</hi> I ſaid to be <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nition of parts ſeparate, no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſubſtance concurring.</hi> This kind of Union Chirurgeons aver, to be performed by the firſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Concarnation,</hi> I deſined to be <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nition of parts disjoyned, by the intervention of a middle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> This is ſaid by Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be done by the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: for the better procuring of Unition in Wounds, I propoſed ſeven Duties, which a Chirurgeon is to perform to Nature, to further
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52816:147"/>her endeavour in this Action: which I hitherto have proſecuted in ſix ſeveral Chapters. Now the Order of Doctrine requires, that I ſhew, by what means Unition is procured in Wounds.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, I will ſhew, how Agglutination is brought to paſs. Then I will ſhew how <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> be Concarnation is procured. And this Order I have choſen, for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons moving me thereto: For firſt, Agglutination is a more ſimple kind of Unition, becauſe it is performed without any middle coming between the wounded parts ſevered. Secondly, becauſe it is more ſpeedily performed than Concarnation: Thirdly, becauſe in it there is neither ſuch Art and Skill, nor ſuch choice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments required, as are in <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Now to bring <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, the firſt kind of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to paſs, three curative Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations offer themſelves: Firſt, the brims of the Wound are to be joyned together. Secondly, the parts joyned together muſt be ſo kept. Thirdly, Agglutinative Medicaments muſt be applied.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Indication is to be performed by the Chirurgeon: for he is to bring together with his hand the Brims or Lips of the Wound gaping: In bringing of the gaping Lips of the Wound together, five things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt is, that he bring gently, and by degrees, not violently or ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the parts ſevered.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that the parts disjoyned be equally brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not ſtretching one more than another, unleſs one part will not admit dilating: as when it cleaves to a Bone, the other being fleſhy for a great diſtance, and at liberty.</p>
                     <p>The third is, that if the Brims of the Wound have become ſtiff, by reaſon of the cold Air (they having for a ſpace remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered) they be fomented with <hi>Hydrelaeum,</hi> a Medicament made of Oyl and Water. The propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oyl and Water is to be conjectured from the conſtitution of the whole Body, as well as from the temperature of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. As for Example: If the party wounded be of a dry and thin habit of Body, more Oyl than Water is to be taken, as one part of Water, and two of Oyl; but if the habit of the Body be fleſhy ſucculent, more Water is to be uſed than Oyl.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in this Conjunction equality muſt he obſerved. So the <hi>Superſicies</hi> of the one part of the Wound muſt exquiſitely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Superſicies</hi> of the other part: and there muſt be a due cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between the inner ſide: Otherwiſe the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> will be ugly and unequal.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, no Doſil or Pledget muſt be put between the parts of the Wound ſeparated, when you mean to conſolidate the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts by the firſt Intention, for then you ſhall cauſe fleſh to grow, and procure the Unition of the parts according to the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond Intention,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52816:148"/>which is the keeping of united parts together, it is performed by three means. The firſt is by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatio</hi> or dry Stitching, as it is termed: The ſecond is by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> or Stitching with a Needle: The third is <hi>Faſcüs,</hi> by Rolling, <hi>Laqueatio</hi> or dry Stitching is, when pieces of Cloth being placed on each ſide of the Wound, the parts of the Wound disjoyned are brought together, by drawing the pieces of the Cloth with a Needle and Thred.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Stitching we uſe in three Caſes: Firſt is, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come conveniently to roll the wounded part, as in tranſverſe Wounds. The ſecond is, when the external Beauty is like to be impaired, by making of new Scars, as it happens in Wounds of the Face. The third is, when the parties wounded will not admit <hi>Sutura,</hi> or Stitching with the Needle; as Women, and eminent Perſons.</p>
                     <p>In the Application of the dry Stitch, three things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The firſt is the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pieces of Cloth. The ſecond is the means by which they are to cleave to the wounded part. The third is the form of them.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt; the pieces of Cloth muſt be ſtrong, that they yield not unto the Thread, when they are drawn. Secondly, one muſt anſwer another: Thirdly, they muſt be hemmed, or doubled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wound; but they muſt be ravelled where they are furtheſt from the Wound.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond: The means by which theſe Clouts are to cleave to the Skin firmly, ought to be wonderful emplaſtick Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I will ſet down a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſhall be this; Diſſolve Iſinglaſs in Vinegar, and by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bring it to the conſiſtence of Glew.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſhall be this: ℞ <hi>Farin. volat. Maſtiches, Gypſi, cocti, Armen. Aloes, Gummi, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacanth. &amp; Arab. an.</hi> ℈j. <hi>fiat ex omnibus pulvis, qui ovi allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini admiſtus conſiſtentiam mellis referat.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As concerning the third, to wit. the form of theſe Clouts, let them be of the form of the wounded part. If therefore the part be Triangular, let the Clouts be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular. However, let the form be ſuch, as is fitteſt to draw the wounded parts together. As for Example, if the Cheek be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſverſly, becauſe the upper Cloth muſt not be Quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (for ſo it ſhould cover the Eye) it muſt be cut Triangular, and reach to the Temple of the Head.</p>

                     <p>Now the tyings of the Threads ought to be diſtant one inch from another: So much I have thought good to deliver unto you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Laqueation or dry Stitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now I am, according to the order of Doctrine, ſet down by my ſelf, to diſcourſe briefly <hi>de Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ris</hi> or Stitching with a Needle or Needles.</p>
                     <p>Of Stitching with Needles theſe five Points are to be obſerved. Firſt, what is meant by this Stitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Secondly, the divers Kinds of it: Thirdly, the Uſes of it: Fourthly, the Inſtruments which are uſed about this Operation: The laſt Point ſhall contain the Documents, which ſhall inform you, how this Operation is to be performed according to Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sutura</hi> then or Stitching is the beinging together of the Lips of a Wound by a Needle threaded, and the keeping of them together by theſe two means.</p>
                     <p>Of Stitching there are two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; for either the Brims of the wounded parts are kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Thread only, or elſe the Needle alſo is left in them.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt ſort of Stitching there are three kinds. 1. Is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura continuata</hi> or the Glovers Stitch: This kind of Stitch we uſe in the wounded Guts, when the Excrements come out of the Wound, and the Guts muſt be ſtitched. We uſe it alſo when great Branches of the <hi>Aorta</hi> and <hi>Vena cava</hi> are wounded, and there is a great Flux of Blood; if we can conveniently come to the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels wounded.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of Stitching is <hi>Sutura non continuata:</hi> This kind is performed by taking, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtitches each being diſtant from another, ſo far as the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wound ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and the Chirurgeon ſhall think fit: So many ſuch ſtitches may be taken, as ſhall be able to bring the Lips of a Wound to a proportionate ſmoothneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Skin. In every Stitch the ends of the Threads are to be cut off near to the Knots, that they ſtick not to the Emplaiſter.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of this Stitching is called <hi>Gaſtroraphia:</hi> This is uſed when the great Muſcles of the Belly, and the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a large Wound. Of this I will diſcourſe, when I come to the Wounds of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of Stitching is, when both the Needles are left in the Wound, and the Thread alſo is uſed. In this kind of Stitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Needles are paſſed through the Lips of the Wound, and they are brought together, the Needles are left there, and twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about both the ends as Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors do when they faſten their Needles to their Sleeve: This Stitching is to be uſed in the cure of the Hare-lip, and when the <hi>Trachea Arteria</hi> is wounded. In ſtead of Needles we may uſe Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Braſs Pins: And when they are twiſted about, their ends may be cut off with a pair of ſmall Nippers, made for ſuch a purpoſe, to avoid the cumberſomeneſs of the ſharp ends of the Pins.</p>
                     <p>The uſes of Stitching are three; for either we uſe Stitching to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a quick Agglutination of the Wound: therefore it is called <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52816:149"/>incarnativa.</hi> And in this kind of Stitching the Brims of the Wound are to be brought near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>Or the ſecond uſe of Stitching is to keep the Brims of a Wound in a reaſonable diſtance one from another. And it is called <hi>Sutura retentiva:</hi> this kind of Stitching we are to uſe when a Wound can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be united after the firſt, but ſecond Intention; wherefore in this the Lips ought not to be too far aſunder, leſt the Air cool the parts too much; nor too near, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Agglutination is not to be expected.</p>
                     <p>The third uſe of Stitching is to ſtay Bleeding, as when a Vein or Artery is wounded. This kind of Stitching is called <hi>Sutura ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Inſtruments requiſite for Stitching are Needles, Thread, and the Stitching-Quill. As for the Needles, they ought to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Steel or Silver. Thoſe of Silver will bend beſt, but then they muſt not be hardned by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Anvil. The Steel Needles you may diſtemper by holding them lapped in brown Paper wet for a while in the flame of a Candle. But it is good to have ſtill ſome in readineſs crooked as well as ſtreight.</p>
                     <p>Their Points may be round, ſlat, three ſquare, or four ſquare. The ſquare-pointed Needles pierce beſt. They ought to have good Eyes, and well grooped, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Threads readily, and couch them the better.</p>
                     <p>As for the Thread, we uſe moſt commonly White, or Crimfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilk Thread: black is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for it is moſt commonly rotten, and frets. But the Low-Country white Thread made of the beſt Hemp hath no fellow: for it ſwells in the Wound, and cuts not as Silk does, which grows ſmall, and cuts too ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>The Stitching-Quill, called in Latin <hi>Canaliculus feneſtratus,</hi> ought for the credit of the Chirurgeon to be of Silver. It hath two Uſes. Firſt, it keeps the Needles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ſtays the oppoſite part of the Wound, that the Needle may the more readily paſs through the adverſe Lip. Now it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that I ſet down, according to my Propoſition, ſome Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which teach what remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things are to be obſerved, when you go about to ſtitch. Theſe are in number thirteen.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We are to labour to ſtitch with the greateſt eaſe that may be, that the Patient may the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let the Lips of the Wound be with moderation brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for if they be too ſtraitly drawn together, the flowing of the Quittour will be hindred, and ſo a Tumor will be procured: But if they be left gaping, the inner parts will be cooled by the Air.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Knots of the Threads muſt be ſure: otherwiſe they may looſe, and ſo we muſt be inforced to ſtitch the ſecond time, which will be more terrible to the Patient than the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In Stitching we muſt beware of the Chords and Nerves: for if they be touched, great pain will enſue.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If Ligaments be cut aſunder,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52816:149"/>we are not to ſtitch them, for it is but labour loſt, becauſe they are only united by the ſecond Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In all parts of the Body the Skin may be ſtitcht, yea even in the Joints, deep Wounds, and Wounds of the Bones, after they have been ſmoothed with the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatory: for by this means the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rutick Parts are covered, defended both the Air, the natural Heat is lept in, and the Cure is better performed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A reaſonable quantity of the Brims of the Wound is to be taken by the Stitches, otherwiſe if the Stitches break, we ſhall cauſe filth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranverſe Scars.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let the Stitches be diſtant by the diſtance of the breadth of the Fore-finger; or the leaſt Finger at the leaſt: for if they be too thick, they will cauſe the more pain; if they be too thin, they will hinder Unition.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In deep Wounds of fleſhy perts, we muſt take deep Stitches; for if the Skin only be ſtitched, the Wound will only ſuperficially heal; and the Quittour ſetling in the bottom, will cauſe Apoſtemation and a hollow Ulcer.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In ſtreight Wounds of the limbs we may ſpare Stitching: for the Lips may be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Laqueation and Rolling: But if the Wounds be tranſverſe, we are always to uſe Stitching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fleſh and all other Parts in ſuch Wounds ſhrink towards the ſound Parts, and ſo gape much.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If Wounds be in the Joints; we are to draw a good quantity of Blood. Firſt, becauſe the Joints are weak, and ſo apt to receive the influxion of Humors. Secondly, becauſe they require ſtrong Deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Thirdly, becauſe the Joints being weak, it may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that too much Blood may cauſe a ſuffocation of the natural heat.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In Wounds of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Phlebotomy is not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Firſt, becauſe they require not great Deſiccation. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we uſe large Phlebotomy in them, we take away the fewel of the natural heat, wherewith they abound.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. In long Wounds we are to begin from one of the ends; but in ſhort Wounds (as in curing the Hare-lip) we are to begin at the middle; for ſo we ſhall ſhun purſing together of the Lips of the Wound, which will cauſe inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Skin, and ſo deformity.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Agglutinative Medicaments, and Rolling.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter I affirmed, that the Lips of the Wounds, which are to be united by Aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ought not only to be brought together, but to be kept ſo alſo: I ſet down in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner three means by which the Brims are kept together, to wit, Laqueation or dry Stitch; <hi>Sutura,</hi> the Stitch with Needle and Thread; and <hi>Faſciae,</hi> Rolling.</p>
                     <p>Having amply diſcourſed of the firſt two, now I am to ſpeak of the third mean, to wit, Rolling. <hi>Faſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio aut deligatio per faſcias,</hi> is when we labour to keep the Lips of the Wound, that they may the ſooner and more firmly be united together by the means of Rolling. As concerning this mean, which induſtrious Chirurgeons have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, to attain to their end and ſcope, which is the Unition of the parts disjoyned, I will ſet down theſe three Points: The firſt ſhall be of the matter of Rollers. The ſecond ſhall be of the divers kinds of Rolling in Wounds. In the third Point I will ſhew how they are to be applied according to Art.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the matter of Rollers, they ought to be of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen: for woollen Rollers are apt to admit ſtretching, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make ſuch conſtriction as thoſe of Linnen do. Secondly, they cauſe itching, and heat the part too much, by which means attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humors is cauſed, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the natural temperature of the part, and ſo hinders the Unition of the parts of it ſevered.</p>
                     <p>Now the Linnen Rollers muſt not be of Cloth too new; for then they will be too ſtiff and hard: nor of Cloth too much worn, for then they will be too weak. Neither muſt they be of Cloth too thick, for then they will be too heavy and boiſterous; nor too thin, for then they will be moſt apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wrinkles, which is unſeemly. They muſt alſo be of even Cloth; not having unequal Threads; for ſo they will cauſe Pits in the Skin. Beſides this, they ought to be clean; for filth in Rollers ſtops the Pores, and hinders the Perſpiration, and ſo may bring Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Dimenſions of Rollers, thoſe which are appointed for the Trunk of the Body, ought to be broadeſt: Then thoſe which are ordained for the Thighs: Next unto theſe thoſe that are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Arms: The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt are moſt fit for Fingers and Toes. As for the length, it is to be found out by the number
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52816:150"/>of Circumvolutions as ſhall be found fit and requiſite.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the divers ſorts of Rollings, <hi>Galen</hi> hath left a whole Treatiſe of them; by his Pains and Labour he hath deſerved a thankful Commemoration from all Poſterity. But all what he hath ſet down, cannot be applied to this Subject which we have in hand: Only four kinds do ſerve our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to wit, <hi>Incarnativa, Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva, Expulſiva</hi> and <hi>Aequans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faſcia Incarnativa,</hi> or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Rolling, appointed for Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, is of two ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is performed by a Roller with two ends. Now in this ſort we muſt begin to roll in the ſound part, oppoſite to the Wound, and roll upwards, and ſo return to the wounded part with one end; with the other end we are to roll downwards, croſſing the former, that the Lips of the Wound may be artificially brought together. In this kind of rolling, the Wound muſt be twice as broad as the Roller, becauſe by this kind of rolling, the Roller draws the Wound together two times: Once rolling upward, and once rolling downward, and ſo to avoid wrinkling, the Roller ought not to be as broad as the Wound.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native rolling, is performed by one Cloth, which muſt be broader than the Wound. The middle of it we apply to the ſound part, that the ſides may meet above the Wound; then we are to ſow the ſides of the Roller together with a tranſverſe Stitch: But this kind of Rolling is not ſo ready as the firſt, becauſe at every dreſſing we muſt cut the former Stitches and uſe new.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faſcia retentiva,</hi> is that kind of Rolling, which is uſed to keep cloſe to the wounded part, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, as Pledgets, Emplaſters, Boulſters, Clouts, and ſuch like. A ſimple Roller will ſerve for this purpoſe. This kind of Rolling ought to be no ſtricter than is ſufficient to ſtay the Applications; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may hinder the influence of the nouriſhment to the part, and ſo procure a ſideration or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the wounded part.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of Rolling is called <hi>Faſcia expulſiva,</hi> or the repelling kind of Rolling. This manner of Rolling ſuffers not any thing to lodge in the cavity of the Wound. Now ſeeing defluxions moſt commonly invade the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent parts, in this caſe, we are to begin our Rolling in the ſound parts below the Wound, and ſo to proceed to the wounded part; whither when you are come, you are to uſe fewer or more looſe Circumvolutions, and ſo to aſcend to the ſound part above the Wound, and then to uſe more ſtrict rolling to hinder the deſcent of any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; and ſo by this ſame kind of Rolling we wring out the Matter which hath already flowed, and hinder the influence of any new Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faſcia aequans,</hi> or a ſmoothing Rolling, is that which reduces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal parts, whereof ſome are high, ſome low, to a decent equality: this is brought to paſs by Boulſters and a ſimple Roller.</p>
                     <p>There are other ſorts of Rollings beſides theſe; yet either not ſo
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52816:151"/>neceſſary, or belonging to other operations in Chirurgery, as <hi>faſcia prohibitiva apoſtematis,</hi> that kind of rolling which hinders Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. In this caſe we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our rolling about the Wound, and to go upward to the joint of the ſound part. Contrary to this is <hi>faſcia apoſtematis factiva,</hi> that kind of rolling which cauſes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemation. There is alſo <hi>faſcia disjunctiva,</hi> that kind of rolling which keeps parts aſunder, and <hi>faſcia directiva,</hi> that ſort of roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which reduces diſtorted and crooked Members to their natural Figure: Of theſe I will diſcourſe, when I treat of thoſe points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are required.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning Rolling, this only remains, that I ſet down ſome Duties which are required of a Chirurgeon when he goes about to roll. The Firſt is that he be nimble and quick in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching, that the Patient be not wearied. The Second is, That he carry a light Hand; for ſo he ſhall not hurt the Patient. The Third is, That he roll handſomely to content the Eye. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, we are to have a care that threads hang not at the Roller, leſt we might ſeem to have robbed Beggars of their rags.</p>
                     <p>In the former Chapter I affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> or agglutination was performed by three Intentions: to wit, by bringing of the lips of the Wound together, by keeping them together, and by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of agglutinative Medicaments. Having ſet down how the two firſt Indications are artificially to be done; now am I to deliver unto you what agglutinative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſitteſt to procure agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe Medicaments I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver theſe three points: the Firſt ſhall be of their Matter: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhall be of the divers kinds of them: The Third ſhall ſet down the artificial application of them. As for their Matter, they ought to be cooling or temperate, to hinder Inflammations; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent, to reſiſt the Influxion of Humors; and drying, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten conſolidation. Theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are of two ſorts; for they are either ſimple or compound.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52816:152"/>Wounds as Nature her ſelf is able to cure. For Firſt, Cold is hurtful for Wounds: Secondly, it may procure a Gangrene in Bodies which have ſmall ſtore of natural heat. Oil in like manner is not convenient, if it be ſimple, becauſe it moiſtens too much. The whites of Eggs alſo are to be rejected, when we mean to glutinate a Wound: Firſt, becauſe they ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dry: Secondly, becauſe they do not penetrate; yea, if glutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Powders be mingled with them, they hinder their penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But what ſhall we ſay of hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed clean Clouts? I Anſwer, that they alſo are not to be uſed becauſe they only drie the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,</hi> and paſs not to the cavity of the Wound: As for the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or bleſſing, it is but a device of crafty knaves, abuſing the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and ſimplicity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people.</p>
                     <p>Now, to ſpeak a word or two of the application of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, which was the laſt point propoſed by me to be handled, concerning Medicaments: If the Wound afford but ſmall ſtore of Matter, it is only to be dreſſed every other day: but if plenty of Matter, it is to be dreſſed once every day: but never twice a day, for then the Air will do more harm than tho Medicament good. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they palpably erre, who think often dreſſing to further Conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Secondly, if you perceive the Lips of the Wound to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate or agglutinate, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cut the ſtitches, whether this happen the Second, Third, or Fourth day: For unition after the firſt intention is moſt commonly performed in this time: The next day following, when you ſee the Lips firmly to cleave together, pull out the threads with your <hi>Forceps</hi> or Fingers.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How a Wound is to be cured after the Second Intention.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former two Chapters, I have ſhewed you, how Wounds are to be handled, which are to be cured by Agglutination, or the Firſt Intention: Now order of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine admoniſhes me to go on, and to teach in like manner, how Wounds are to be dreſſed, which are to be united by the Second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, called by the Grecians <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by this word Concarnation. It is not amiſs ſometimes to coin vocables of Art to expreſs the matter which is in hand.</p>
                     <p>Now to cure a Wound after the Second Intention, three curative Indications do offer themſelves. The Firſt is, to procure the filling of the Wound by new fleſh. The Second is, to abate the Fleſh, if it become ſuperfluous: And the Third is, to skin the part wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when ſufficient fleſh is grown.</p>
                     <p>As for the Firſt Indication, which is the filling of the gaping of a Wound with fleſh; of it you are to conſider the Motives, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to go about this manner of unition, and the means by which it is brought to paſs. In five caſes you are to go about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation of Wounds by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Intention.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Firſt is, If there be loſs of ſubſtance, whether it be fleſh, or any other ſubſtance, as Bone, Cartilage, or Ligament. Neither is this a general rule: for if the parts be looſe and flaggy, they may admit unition after the Firſt Intention: as we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the curing of the Hare-lip, and Wounds of the fore part of the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you are to attempt this kind of Cure, where you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently bring the lips of the Wound together by ſtitching or rolling: as in great wounds of the Joints, and when the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are cut aſunder, as the great Tendon, which is called <hi>Nerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Hectorius,</hi> and is inferted into <hi>Os calcis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this is to be done when we look upon the ſcaling of a Bone, or the ſcparation of the piece of a Ligament or Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we are to take this courſe, when otherwiſe a great and dangerous Flux of Blood cannot be avoided, as in wounds of the Neck, where the internal jugular Veins and ſoporal Arteries are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, we are to addreſs our
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52816:153"/>ſelves to this manner of Unition, when great ſtore of Quittour is like to flow to the wounded part; and this falls out in four caſes.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, when we cannot hinder the influxion of Humors by rolling, as in wounds of the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and Joints.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in cacochymical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in perſons who have a ſcirrhoſity in the Liver and Spleen.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the wounded party have a contagious Diſeaſe, as the Pox. In theſe caſes we are rather to attempt Unition by the Second, than Firſt Intention, eſpecially if we fear no deformity by reaſon of a ſcarr: As it happens in wounds of all the parts of the Body, if you except the Face.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes which ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you not to attempt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the firſt Intention, when there is loſs of ſubſtance, are theſe: Firſt, Pain and Inflammation will enſue, by reaſon of the violent bringing of the lips of the Wound together: Secondly, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a great deformity in the part wounded, after that is cured. So much then concerning the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, which are to admoniſh a Chirurgeon, when he is about to cure a Wound, whether he ought to perform this by the Second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Now I am to ſhew you, what means are moſt apt to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate new fleſh: Theſe means are in number three: the principal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe: The cauſes adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: The material cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The principal efficient cauſe is the natural Temperature of the whole Body, and of the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected alſo, which ought to incline to drineſs: If it be preſent it is to be maintained; but if you find it not, you are to procure it by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, Purgation, and the right ordering of thoſe things which are called not Natural. But ſeeing I have amply diſcourſed of theſe points, when I ſet down the methodical cure of Ulcers, I will remit you to that Treatiſe, and will not trouble you with a fruitleſs repetition of the ſame things.</p>
                     <p>The adjuvant cauſes are two, to wit, the Chirurgeon, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Medicaments. As for the Chirurgeon, he ought to dreſs the party with as much eaſe as may be. Secondly, he ought to have a care that the applications be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Wound very neatly: for by want of this, a ſlubberer and ſloven is diſcerned from a cleanly workman. This the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon can hardly perform, if he be not cunning in fitting of Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon which the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be laid, which are to be applied to the wounded part.</p>
                     <p>Now the Liniments are of three ſorts; <hi>Turundae, Tentae,</hi> and <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Turundae</hi> or doſils repreſent in Olive in Figure <hi>Tentae</hi> or Tents are long, and ſomewhat ſmall. <hi>Splenia</hi> or Pledgets ought to repreſent the Spleen of living Creatures, from whence they have their denomination.</p>
                     <p>The Pledgets, which are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought firſt to be ſomewhat larger than the Wound: Secondly, they ought to be armed with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52816:153"/>which have a moderate tenacity or clammineſs, and which ought to have a faculty to ſtay an Inflammation, to aſſwage pain, and to repell Humors, which might flow to the part. Such are <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma</hi> diſſolved in Oil of Myrtles, Quinces or Roſes, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Tutia magiſtrale, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Minio.</hi> If for the preſent you be deſtitute of theſe compoſitions, you may uſe the red aſtringent Wine, or Tanners Wooſe, or Smiths wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clarified, mingled with one of the Oils befor-named: and then it is good to moiſten the Rollers in this Medicament. Theſe Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be made of Lint or Tow; the Tow ought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhivers: It dries more than Lint, if it be of Hemp.</p>
                     <p>The material cauſe of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of new fleſh is laudable Blood, anſwering the temperature of the part wounded. So if a ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick part be wounded, the Blood ought to be ſomewhat cold, thick, and dry, which is to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mean to unite the parts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But if a fleſhy part be wounded, the Blood is to be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more humid. Having ſet down the part of the Chirurgeon, whom I affirmed to be the firſt adjuvant cauſe, in producing new fleſh, now am I to to acquaint you with thoſe Medicaments which are termed by Artiſts Sarcotical, or apt to engender new and tender fleſh.</p>
                     <p>All Sarcotical Medicaments, as they ought to be of a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, ſo they ought to be void of a ſharp and biting quality. The differences of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments are either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the degrees of their dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, or from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of their kinds. From the degrees of drying, theſe three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are drawn: For either they are of a mean operation, and theſe will ſerve when the Quittour is <hi>Album, Leve,</hi> and <hi>Aequate,</hi> white, ſmooth, and of an equal ſubſtance, one part of it not being thin, and the other grumous. Or they are ſomewhat ſtronger, as when the matter which flows from the Wound is thin and ichorous; for then ſtronger deſiccatives are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to incraſſate or thicken this thin matter. The Third degree comprehends the ſtrongeſt deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catives: As when <hi>Sordes</hi> or a Sluch appears in the Wound, theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are called <hi>Medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta detergentia</hi> the Chirurgeon's Mundificatives; and thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 1 <hi>meth.</hi> 12. ought to be of a drying and penetrating faculty; For thoſe things which are united in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of living Creatures, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by moiſture: wherefore dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſpending the Humidity, they are again ſeparated; as we may for an example ſee in a Table glued together, if it be too much dried by the fire.</p>
                     <p>Now there be two kinds of theſe drying Medicaments, for either they are ſimple or compound. The ſimple drying Medicaments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Meth.</hi> 3. are of three ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, dry in the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for thoſe who have had but a tender and ſoft conſtitution of Body, as are Children and young Gentlewomen. Children are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of this conſtitution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52816:154"/>they attain the Fourteenth year of their age.</p>
                     <p>The Second ſort is of ſuch as are dry in the end of the Firſt degree, and the beginning of the Second.</p>
                     <p>The Third ſort is of ſuch as are drie in the end of the Second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: and as theſe befit bodies of very hard and firm conſtitution of Body, ſuch as Sailers, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of hard Trades have, as Smiths and Felt-makers: So the Second ſort of Deſiccatives are fitteſt for ſuch as are of a mean habit of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, neither too looſe nor too hard, as Gentlemen in their conſiſting age.</p>
                     <p>Unto the Firſt degree of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccatives theſe may be referred: <hi>Thus, Farina Hordei, &amp; Fabarum, ut &amp; Zeae utriuſque, Maſtiche, Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in guttis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe of the Second degree you may refer all ſorts of Reſines, as the yellow, the black Ship-Pitch, and <hi>Elemi,</hi> clarified Honey, <hi>Fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Cicerum, &amp; metallica quaedam; ut Mintum, Lithargarus, Phanbum vſtum; ſed omnia lota.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Third degree you may refer: <hi>Farina Orobi amari, Lupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, Iris, Ariſtolochia utraque, Myrrha, Sarcocolla, Lapis calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris, Tutia, Aesuſtum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus thoſe Simples which are drying in the Firſt degree, ſerve for thoſe who are of a ſoft habit of body: Thoſe which are in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree, ſerve for thoſe who are of a mean habit: but thoſe which are of the Third degree, are fit for thoſe who are of a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh habit of Body, as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now what I have ſpoken of the habit of the whole body, I would have you to apply it to the habit of every ſeveral part: So the fleſhy parts are ſofteſt, althô there be degrees: amongſt them: The Lips are ſofteſt of all: The Sinews and Membranes are of a mean hardneſs, but the Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Bones are hardeſt of all.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe ſimple Sarcotical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, you may frame unto your ſelves ſundry compoſitions, as occaſion ſhall move you: Only I will ſet down one for a pattern, and it is this: ℞ <hi>Balſam. Hyperic. ſimpl.</hi>

This I have termed my <hi>Baſilicum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrale;</hi> I will not ſtand much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the commendation of it; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will praiſe it: If variety of ſuch compound Sarcoſical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments doth delight any one, let him have recourſe unto the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatories of ſundry Men, and Nations: If he be not by them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſied, I ſhall think that he hath an <hi>Appetitus caninus</hi> of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that cathaeretick Medicaments, as <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſtum, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>It is not enough in curing by the Second Intention to procure the growing of new fleſh in Wounds; but we muſt be wary that it do not overgrow. If this happen, we muſt take order with it. The cauſe of ſuperfluous fleſh is too much Blood ſent unto the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52816:154"/>part. This is abated by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrict Diet, and the uſe of Aliments, which do not feed much. Secondly, cooling and aſtringent Medicaments are to be applied to the ſound parts adjacent to the Wound. Thirdly, we are to uſe hard Frictions and ſtrait Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures to the oppoſite part: for by all theſe means the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate influence of Blood is ſtayed.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuperfluous or proud Fleſh is taken away three manner of ways. Firſt, by an Inſtrument, as an Inciſion-Knife or a Raſor, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by rubbing it away by a rough Linnen Cloth. Thirdly, it is removed by Cathaeretical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments: ſuch are <hi>Alumen uſtum, Vnriclum calcinatum, Mer. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cititatus.</hi> If the party wounded be of a tender habit of Body. <hi>Merc. lotus</hi> will ſerve, being thus mingled: ℞ <hi>

Whoever he be that has brought a Wound to that paſs, that the ſupercreſcent Fleſh requires a ſtronger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theretical Medicament than theſe, he muſt be a novice in his Art.</p>
                     <p>The Wound being thus ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently incarnate nothing remains, but to cicatrize it. Concerning Cicatrizations theſe three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ariſe. Firſt, what manner of skinning is moſt laudable? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we are to go about skinning? The third ſhall be of the cauſes which procure skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. To the firſt I anſwer, that the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> which in colour and conformation beſt repreſents the natural Skin, is moſt laudable. To the ſecond Queſtion I anſwer, that we are not to go about the skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Wound before the Fleſh be ſomewhat higher than the natural Skin: for otherwiſe the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> will be hollow, which is unſeemly. If a piece of a Bone ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken out or caſt, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhun a hollow <hi>Cicatrix.</hi> As for the Cauſes;</p>
                     <p>The efficient Cauſe is a faculty reſident in the ſound Skin, adjacent to the Wound: So we ſee skinning to begin from the Brims of the natural Skin.</p>
                     <p>The material Cauſe is Fleſh hardned.</p>
                     <p>The adjuvant Cauſes are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulotical or skinning Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Medicaments, we are firſt to conſider their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; Secondly, to ſet down their kinds. As for their faculty, they ought firſt to dry ſtrongly, and to reach the end of the third degree of Deſiccation; becauſe ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments ought not only to conſume the extraneous Humidity, but the natural alſo. Secondly, ſeeing they
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52816:155"/>are to ſtay the influxion of more Blood, which might ingender more new Fleſh, they ought to be very aſtringent, ſo that it may be diſcerned by the Tongue and Palate. Yet they are to have no Acrimony, for then they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe Medicaments are of two ſorts; for they are either Simple or Compound. For wounded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a ſoft Habit, theſe will ſerve; Frankincenſe, the bark of the Pine-tree, Lead calcined and waſhed, Oyſter-ſhells burned and waſhed: for thoſe who have a mean habit of Body theſe will ſerve, which are drying in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third degree; as are unripe Galls, the Flowers and Rinds of wild Pomegranates, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> Myrtil berries, <hi>Sanguis Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis, Terra <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra, Rubrica fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brilis.</hi> For thoſe who have a very hard habit of Body, uſe <hi>Aes uſtum, Alumen uſtum, Capue mortuum Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioli diſtillati ablutum.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of a Convulſion in Wounds.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HItherto I have delivered unto you ſuch Precepts as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all Wounds in general. Now the Method which I propoſed unto my ſelf in the beginning of this Treatiſe of Wounds, doth require that I ſet down in like manner ſuch Points as concern all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Wounds.</p>
                     <p>The Differences of Wounds are taken from three things. The firſt from their Accidents: The ſecond from the Nature of Wounds: The third, from the parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed From the Accidents, Wounds may be ſaid either to have been known unto the Ancients, or not to have been known unto them. From the Nature of Wounds theſe Differences are taken: Wounds are either Simple or Compound. A ſimple Wound is that which hath neither any cruel Symptom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> any other kind of Grief, which may draw the Chirurgeon from going about the curing of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention ſet down in the general Doctrine of Wounds. Thither then I ſend you: for I mean to avoid fruitleſs repetitions. A compound Wound is, that which hath either a cruel Symptom, or ſame Diſeaſe, or both annexed.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms are in number five: Pain, Fainting, a Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Palſie, and Crudity. Of Pain and Fainting, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed already; becauſe they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen often, as well in ſimple as compound Wounds, as hath been ſhewed, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. Wherefore I am only to ſpeak of the laſt three: of which a Convulſion is the firſt: If you require a Deſcription of it: receive this: A Convulſion is a contraction or drawing together of the Muſcles or Parts which are appointed for voluntary Motion towards their beginning; which are either the Brain, or the <hi>Spinalis Medulla</hi> or Chine of the Back.</p>
                     <p>A Convulſion is two-fold: for it is either natural or unnatural: A natural Convulſion happens when one of two Muſcles appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Motion is contracted, the other being tranverſly wounded. This is to be ſeen in Wounds of the Head, when one of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcles is tranſverſly cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; and in Wounds of the Fingers: for if the inner Muſcle of a Finger be cut aſunder tranſverſly, the outward Muſcle is contracted. An unnatural Convulſion is that which happens not becauſe one of two Muſcles, ordained to perform this ſame action, is tranverſly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52816:156"/>wounded. This is two-fold, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus convulſivus,</hi> and <hi>Convulſio vera. Motus convulſivus,</hi> or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Motion, is cauſed of a thin and halituous Matter, moving too and fro, toſſing the Nerve: And it doth not continue long, for the Matter being kept in the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the Brain and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Nerves are ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they loſe their Action; from whence enſues the Palſie on that ſide: then a malign Vapor being raiſed from hence, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the beginning of the Nerves of the ſound part not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoiled, the Nerves are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo <hi>Motus convulſivus</hi> is cauſed.</p>
                     <p>If any man demand, why a malign Vapor reſting in the Brain procures not only a ſtupidity, but a Convulſion, if the beginning of the Nerves be affected?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that this happens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Body can have Motion in it ſelf, which is not Fibrous: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the Brain is not Fibrous, it cannot have Extenſion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: But the beginning of the Nerves may, although they be ſoft: for they are framed of many Filaments covered with a Membrane. Not unlike to this is <hi>Spaſmus flatulentus</hi> or the Cramp. This is cauſed of a thin Humor or Flatuoſity nipping the beginning of the Muſcle: ſo you may obſerve, that they who are troubled with a Quartan Ague, or who increaſe windineſs in the Body, are moſt ſubject to this Grief. This very often is a forerunner of a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion: Wherefore it ſeems only to differ from a true Convulſion, that in this the Matter is leſs ſharp, and the Contraction endures not ſo long.</p>
                     <p>A true Convulſion is that which is cauſed either of a plentiful greaſie Matter ſtopping the Nerves, or of a drineſs purſing of them; or by conſent, a noiſome Vapor being ſent to the beginning of the Nerves of the Muſcles, and nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them. Of a true Convulſion there are four kinds, <hi>Emproſtlxto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Opiſthotonos, Tetanos</hi> and <hi>Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus cynicus.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, a Convulſion by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or Conſent happens, the Nerves drawing themſelves towards their beginnings, by reaſon of the great pain, which is felt in the wounded part: In this kind of Convulſion Anodyne Medicaments, or ſuch as aſſwage Pain, are to be applied.

                     <p>Thirdly, a Convulſion by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may happen by reaſon of immoderate Cold, making the Nerves ſtiff. In curing of this Symptom. 1. You muſt keep the wounded party in a warm Room; 2. You are to uſe warm Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Oyl of Chamaemil, Dill, Rue, Bayes, Lilies, Rape-Oyl, Dogs greaſe, Bears greaſe, Horſe greaſe.

                     <p>Before I end this Chapter, I will ſet down a few Aphoriſms concerning Convulſions in Wounds, which will ſerve for Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſhall be this: A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion or Raving, which enſueth after immoderate bleeding, is ill, according to <hi>Hippocrat. Aphor.</hi> 3. not only becauſe the Nerves are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but becauſe Choler and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humors offend the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Nerves after the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blood.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if a Convulſion enſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Wound, it is moſt commonly deadly 5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 2. partly becauſe ſharp Humors nip the Nerves: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Nerves muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. <hi>Heurnius</hi> writing upon this Aphoriſm, ſets down a dainty Medicament in this Caſe, which I thought good to impart to you; and it is this: firſt, preſs out the Oyl out of the Seeds of Saint <hi>Johns</hi>-wort; next infuſe the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Herb in the ſame Oyl, This Oyl apply warm.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whoſoever are taken with a <hi>Tetanos,</hi> they die within the ſpace of four days; but if they paſs theſe, they eſcape, 5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 6. For firſt it is a moſt ſharp Diſeaſe, and ſuch do end the fourth day: Second, Nature cannot longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the horrible pain, which is cauſed by the ſtrong Tenſion of the Nerves, both of the fore and back part. One thing is to be noted, that they which die of a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, remain long hot, becauſe they die being ſtifled, the Muſcles appointed for reſpiration being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo convelled: for the Muſcles of the Neck being diſtended, the <hi>Septum tranſverſum</hi> alſo muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert; for Nerves ſpringing from the fourth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck are inſerted into the Midriff, and ſo the Neck ſuffering a Convulſion, Reſpiration is hindred.</p>

                        </gap>ly to be a Dulneſs in Feeling, yet it is taken for a Paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the difficulty as well of Moving as Feeling. It is often a fore-runner of the Palſie, and only differs in the degree of the Cauſe, it being milder. <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> or a Palſie, is the privation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always, and ſometimes of Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo in one or more Parts, proceeding from the ſtopping or intercluding of the animal Spirits, which are the efficient Cauſes of voluntary Motion. By thoſe who have written of this Diſeaſe a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is moved:</p>
                     <p>How it comes to paſs that in a Palſie, ſometimes both Moving and Feeling are taken away; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Motion and not the Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes the Feeling and not the Motion?</p>
                     <p>In thoſe parts wherein there are divers Nerves ſerving for Motion and Feeling, the Anſwer is eaſily made; for in ſuch parts if the Nerves appointed for Motion be only affected, then the Motion is hindred, the Senſe remaining ſound, and if the Nerves appointed for the Senſe be affected, the Senſe is hindred, the Motion remaining: So in the Eye, if the Optick Nerves, the firſt pair be hurt, the Motory, the ſecond pair being ſafe, the Sight is taken away, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Eye remaining; and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52816:159"/>in the Tongue, if the third and fourth Conjugation of Nerves of the Brain be offended, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth pair be found, the Taſte is offended, the Motion of the Tongue continuing, and on the contrary. If the ſame Nerve do afford both Moving and Feeling unto a Part, the Matter is not ſo plain. Authors do aſcribe this to the defect of the Animal Spirits; ſo that Moving may be aboliſhed, Feeling remaining: for fewer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are required for Feeling, than Motion, which muſt have greater ſtrength of the Faculty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Feeling be aboliſhed, the Motion cannot be ſafe: for it is not likely that the weaker Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken away, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould remain. If a Nerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into a Muſcle be ſo affected, that the influence of the Animal Spirit is ſtayed, it may fall out that both Feeling and Moving may be taken away: but if a Nerve being inſerted into a Membrane or into the Skin, be ſo affected, the Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be aboliſhed, the moving of the Member remaining; for theſe ſimilary Parts are not appointed for Motion.</p>
                     <p>The immediate cauſe of a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, I reckon to be ſome unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection of the Nerves, which are inſerted into the parts, which are by Nature deſtinate to voluntary Motion: for from the Nerve every Muſcle hath the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of moving, which carries to it Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Now a Nerve hath a two-fold conſideration; for it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, firſt, as it is a ſimilary part concurring to the compoſition of a Muſcle; or ſecondly, as it is an organical part carrying the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirit from the Brain to it, which is the principal efficient cauſe of Motion.</p>
                     <p>As it is a ſimilary part, it may ſuffer Diſtemperature, this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature all Practicers agree to be a cold and moiſt Diſtemperature; for ſuch a Diſtemperature relaxes the Nerve, and makes it altogether unapt to receive and carry the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The external Cauſes of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature may be the cold Air, the North wind, immoderate <hi>Venus,</hi> narcotical Medicaments, lying in Snow, or in Water, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> 4. <hi>de Loc. affectis, c.</hi> 4. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that one who in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seaſon, in cold and rainy Weather, had lapped his Neck with a wet Cloak, and kept it ſomewhat too long, became para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick in one hand, the Nerves of the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> of the Neck having been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                     <p>The internal Cauſe which brings a Palſie, is a phlegmatick, moiſt and cold Humor; moiſtning and cooling the Nerves too much, and relaxing them, and ſo altering their natural temperature, and making them unfit either to receive th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By Obſtruction it may come to paſs, when as by a thick and a tough Humor the Nerve is ſo ſtopt, that the Animal Spirits cannot paſs.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes of a Compreſſion of a Nerve are ſundry. Firſt, from Humors bearing down the Nerve. Secondly, from a Tumor doing the like. Thirdly, from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion. Fourthly, from a Laxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet if this Laxation, be not ſuddenly performed, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it brings not a Palſie, as we may ſee in thoſe which are Crook-backed. Fifthly, from a ſtrait Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature. Sixthly, too long lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a part, as when we Sleep leaning our Head upon the Palm of our Hand. Seventhly, Cold may be the cauſe; for if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring a Mortification of a Part, it may more eaſily cauſe an Infirmity or Weakneſs of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Denſation or thickning may be procured by two means; Firſt, if the party hath been nouriſhed by thick and ſlimy Meats: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if immoderate Cold hath congealed it.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, a Palſie may be cauſed by Solution of Unity, when the Nerve, which brings the Animal Spirits to the Part, is either cut tranſverſly, or torn, or eroded with a ſharp Humor.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a Palſie are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52816:160"/>to wit, the privation of Moving, and ſometimes of Feeling alſo.</p>
                     <p>The part primarily affected is not ſo eaſily found out: But that you may attain to this, receive theſe Aphoriſms.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If one ſide of the Face be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the Speech hindred, as well as one ſide of the Body, both the Brain and the <hi>Spinalis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla</hi> are affected.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If only one ſide of the Face be troubled, the reſt of the Body being untouched, the Cauſe is only in the Brain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If all the parts of the Head being ſound, either of the ſides be Paralytick, the Cauſe is in one of the ſides of the <hi>Spinalis Medulla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the Arms only be Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the Cauſe is in the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the Diſeaſe be only reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Legs, then you are to conjecture that the Cauſe is in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins and <hi>Os Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. If any ſeveral Part be Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, then the Cauſe is not in the Brain, or the <hi>Spinalis Medulla,</hi> but in the Sprig of ſome Nerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in that Part.</p>
                     <p>As for the Differences of a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; it is either Univerſal, when all the Parts under the Head are ſeiſed upon; or of one ſide only, and then it is called <hi>Hemiplegia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks, receive theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If a Palſie happen becauſe the Nerve is tranſverſly cut aſunder, it is incurable; <hi>Hippoc.</hi> 6. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every ſtrong Palſie proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an inward Cauſe is hard to be cured; becauſe it is cauſed of a groſs, cold and viſcous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which hardly can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Palſie taking an old Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Winter, is hardly cured; becauſe Diſeaſes in the Winter are more rebellious, and the natural heat in ſuch perſons is weak.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Palſie which follows after an Apoplexy is hardly cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cauſe is vehement, the Parts are weak, and there is ſtill a fear of relapſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Palſie wherein both Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Feeling are taken away is more dangerous, than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in only one of theſe Symptoms happens.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A Palſie enſuing after a ſtrong and ſudden Luxation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Spina,</hi> is dangerous; becauſe the Nerves are much bruiſed: and by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation following, they hardly can be reduced.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A trembling after a Palſie is good: for it ſhews that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Nerves by which the Animal Spirits do paſs, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pervious.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If the Paralytick Members be actually hot, there is ſome hope of cure.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If the Paralytick Member be extenuate, and the freſh colour thereof be changed, it can hardly be cured; becauſe the Spirits muſt be few and the natural heat weak.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If the Eye of the Paralytick ſide be weak, the Diſeaſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable: for this argues the defect of the natural heat, and of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. A Fever following after a Palſie gives good hope of Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it warms, dries and diſcuſſes the Matter.</p>

                        <hi>Venenum</hi> or a Poiſon is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Subſtance, not a natural, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the Heart, and which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the nature of Man.</hi> In this deſcription it is called <hi>a Subſtance,</hi> and ſo it is: for contraries are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this ſame Predicament: Now ſeeing <hi>alimentum</hi> or a nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is in the Predicament of <hi>ſubſtantia, venenum</hi> or a Poiſon muſt be in the ſame, ſeeing it is contrary to nouriſhment: for this maintains the nature of Man, the other deſtroys it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> 4. aſſigns this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, that <hi>alimentum</hi> is that which is overcome by Nature, and turned into its Subſtance; but <hi>Venenum</hi> or a Poiſon is that which overcomes Nature, and deſtroys it. In the deſcription it is ſaid to be <hi>a compound Subſtance:</hi> for ſeeing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Philoſophical axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, <hi>actiones ſunt compoſitorum,</hi> actions are produced by things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; a Poiſon muſt be a thing compound, ſeeing the actions of it are manifeſt. It is a folly to think that a Poiſon is only an Accident, for an Accident may either be in the Subject, whereof it is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or abſent from it without the deſtruction of it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed of a Poiſon; for being miniſtred it kills the Party, unleſs it be hindred by Antidotes. One may think that the Poiſon by the biting of a mad Dog, or by the ſtinging of a Scorpion, are Qualities, rather than Subſtances:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52816:162"/>but in truth they are compound ſubſtances, thô the Body ſeem ſmall, and ſcarce to be diſcerned by our Senſes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>de Loc. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. cap.</hi> 5. ſeems to intimate ſo much to us, when he ſaith, that the poiſon of a Scorpion is moſt forcible in efficacy, thô it be but ſmall in quantity.</p>
                     <p>In the deſcription, a poiſon is ſaid to be a ſubſtance <hi>not Natural,</hi> or Preternatural: for things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are always good; but things called preternatural are always of their own nature ill, as Diſeaſes, and the Cauſes of them. Poiſon is ſaid to be <hi>adverſe to the Heart;</hi> becauſe it aims chiefly at the Heart: for as ſoon as one has either taken poiſon inwardly, or is outwardly touched with it, he preſently is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a palpitation of the Heart, weakneſs of the ſame, and laſt of all Swooning and Fainting. In this they differ from purgative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, becauſe theſe only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Stomach: wherefore their correctives ought ſtill to be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them. Laſt of all in the deſcription of a Poiſon, it is ſaid to <hi>corrupt the Nature of Man,</hi> for whether Nature according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> 2. <hi>Phyſic.</hi> be taken for the matter, form, or the whole frame of Man, it corrupts all. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of the Body of Man are the Humors, the Spirits, and the ſolid parts: that theſe are corrupted by poiſon, no Man doubts. If in a Man you take the form to be the Temperament, or what ever is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Temperament, it is overthrown in like manner by Poiſon.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, a Man by Poiſon being deprived of Life, becomes a <hi>Cadaver,</hi> or a dead Carcaſe.</p>
                     <p>But here a doubt ariſes, to wit, How it comes to paſs, that ſome are not hurt by Poiſon?</p>
                     <p>Sundry reaſons may be alledged for this. The Firſt, is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome particular perſons: for ſome have obtained ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from Nature, that hardly any thing can hurt them. <hi>

                     <p>The Second reaſon is the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Bodies; for they who have but a weak Heart, are more eaſily killed by poiſon. They in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>There is a queſtion moved by thoſe who have written of poiſons, whether a poiſon may be made, which not ſuddenly, but ſlowly, and at a determinate time may kill, as within the ſpace of a Moneth, or a quarter of a year, or a whole year? Some are of opinion, that ſuch a poiſon may be compoſed: as <hi>Theophraſtus lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de hiſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ant. cap. de Aconito:</hi> who writes, that it was wont ſo to be prepared, that it was able to kill within the ſpace of a Moneth; ſometimes within the ſpace of two or three Moneths; yea, after a year expired.</p>
                     <p>For the determination of this queſtion, it cannot be doubted, but that a poiſon may be ſo prepared, that it may either ſooner or more ſlowly kill; but that it may kill at a determinate time, it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abſurd: for actions which are produced at a determinate time, proceed from a faculty that works by diſcourſe and judgment: But who can affirm that there is any ſuch faculty in poiſons? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſeeing poiſons are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the nature of Man, I ſee not how they can be contained any long ſpace of time within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Man, not doing him any harm. Thirdly, it is more likely that a purgative Medicament could be miniſtred to work at a definite time, ſeeing it is more mild than a poiſon, but no ſuch Medicament could ever hither to be found out. Only then poiſon may be dreſſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52816:163"/>bodies ſhew their forces ſpeedily, in ſome ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>It may be, that you may ask by what means theſe Poiſons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leteries do kill?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, that they neither kill by their exceſſive qualities, ſeeing we uſe Medicaments hot in the Fourth degree, as <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> and <hi>Cantharides;</hi> nor by their Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, reſulting from a certain mixture of the Elements; but they work by a more hidden and ſecret form, and by a certain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or form infuſed after the Temperature, which is not known to us by the conſtitutive cauſes, but by the effects, as many other things are. This Nature (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Philoſophers ſay) they had from the Creation, and not from the Stars, or any new celeſtial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, as <hi>Aponenſis lib. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you demand what things in Man they chiefly aſſault?</p>
                     <p>I reply, that thoſe things are chiefly the natural heat, and the radical moiſture; for they extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Firſt, and corrupt the Second. One then would think it a ſtrange thing, that the natural heat of the body of Man ſhould ſtir up this propriety of poiſons, its profeſſed Enemy, to quench it ſelf. But Nature has ordained, that the natural heat muſt go about the elaborating of every thing which enters into the body of Man, to find how it may be made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for preſervation of the life of Man. Wherefore it finding poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, goes about to digeſt it, not by the intention of Nature, but by the neceſſity of its action; for it cannot be idle.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſubjects wherein this deletery Property is lodged, are three: a Vapour, a Juyce, an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or a terreſtrial ſubſtance; for what ever poiſons are taken either from Plants or Minerals, or living creatures, they are reſident in one of theſe three ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the divers kinds of poiſons; ſome are artiſicial, ſome natural: If I could ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable differences of both the kinds, I would not: for it were a hainous crime to further the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intentions of ſome malicious perſons of this deſperate age, in this buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>One may wonder why God and Nature have ordained and brought forth poiſon. This wonder we may eaſily qualifie, if we ſay, that poiſons may be conſidered two manner of ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as they are natural Bodies, and ſo they concur to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the World, and they have good uſes. Firſt, they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in ſome Crafts or Trades, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Painting and Dying. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are appointed for the feeding of ſome Creatures: So Starlings feed upon Hemlock, Swallows upon <hi>Cantharides,</hi> the Quails upon Hellebore. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſerve for the curing of ſome Diſeaſes in Man; ſo Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore cures Madneſs, Libbards-bane the ſtinging of a Scorpion; Cakes made of Arſenick are uſed in the Plague-time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, poiſons may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as they are adverſe to our Bodies, and deadly, and ſo they have no uſe; but are abuſed by perverſe and wicked perſons: Thus innumerable ſorts of weapons are

                     <p>If you would know what theſe means are; If the poiſon hath not paſſed further than the part wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if the party be not of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality, tender or fearful, it is good to uſe the actual Cautery, for it doth much ſtay the activity of the poiſon. But that the Eſchar may ſpeedily fall, you are to uſe deep ſcarifications, which muſt reach to the ſound part: Then you are to uſe Medicaments, which are fit to procure the fall of the Eſchar, that the poiſon may have vent to iſſue out. If the poiſon hath paſſed deeply into the Body, beware of uſing of the actual Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; for this were to add grief to grief. If the party be tender and fearful, uſe Ventoſes after ſcarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To the part uſe convenient Medicaments, ſuch as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de paeto</hi> is, or the <hi>Baſilicum</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by me: But with theſe you muſt always mingle Mercury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, or <hi>Turbith</hi> Mineral waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſome <hi>Theriaca Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> or Mithridate or <hi>Antidotus de ſanguinibus,</hi> or <hi>Athanaſia,</hi> or <hi>Electuarium de ovo.</hi> To the parts adjacent, apply attractive Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as <hi>Oxycroceum,</hi> and ſuch as receive the hot Gumms, as <hi>Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Opoponax, Elemi, &amp;c.</hi> This do, unleſs the wounded part be ſo hot that it threatens a Gangrene: for then you muſt go about to obviate this Symptome, leaving the cure of the Grief for a while.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Wounds, until three days be expired, you are to refrain from Bleeding, Purging, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Clyſters: The Party muſt ſleep ſparingly, and uſe a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diet, eating ſuch meats as are of eaſie Digeſtion, and afford a good juyce. During this time you are to miniſter every day, Morning and Evening, one of the Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries afore-named, giving a drachm or more, according to the perſon of the party, in ſome convenient Liquor, as <hi>Carduus</hi>-water, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-water, or Black-cherry-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, adding ſome <hi>Aqua theriacalis.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of a Wound by the biting of a mad Dog.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter, having firſt diſcourſed of Poiſon in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, I ſet down the method of curing ſuch Wounds as are made by a poiſoned weapon. Now am I therefore to deſcend to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of malign compound Wounds, which are procured by the biting or ſtinging of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Beaſts: of theſe there are two ſorts; the biting of a mad Dog; and the biting or ſtinging of Serpents.</p>
                     <p>I will then firſt begin with a Wound cauſed by a mad Dog; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it moſt frequently happens in theſe parts, and Phyſicians and Chirurgeons are ofteneſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the curing of this kind of a Wound. And thô other Beaſts beſides Dogs may be mad, as Wolves, Foxes, Cats, Horſes, and ſundry other, and by biting kill a Man; yet by moſt who have written of this ſubject, this kind of poiſon hath its denomination from the Dog, becauſe he, of all other Beaſts moſt frequently runs mad. This poiſon, which is the cauſe of the Madneſs, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the firſt qualities heat or cold, moiſture or drineſs; for Dogs and Wolves run mad, as well in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold weather, in the middle of Winter, as in the Summer in the Dog-daies.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it muſt be a ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal kind of poiſon which moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is engendred in a Dog by a peculiar property, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this kind of madneſs,, and to communicate it to other living creatures. <hi>Baccius in tractat. de venen.</hi> writes, that he ſaw a Man killed by a mad Houſe-Cock.</p>
                     <p>This poiſon is communicated two manner of waies: Firſt, by biting and the ſlaver: Secondly, by ſlaver without biting: This ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is eaſily imparted by kiſſing any mad Beaſt; for the skin of the Lips of Man are very thin and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo apt to admit this kind of poiſon; yet, ſometimes this poiſon is received by the thick skin of any part; <hi>Matth. de grad. conſil.</hi> 82. affirms one named <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Coquinartus,</hi> by putting his Hand in a mad Dogs mouth, after many daies to have become mad.</p>
                     <p>After that this poiſon is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſome ſooner, ſome more ſlowly become mad; for ſome rage within the ſpace of a few daies, or a week; ſome a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Braſſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. cap.</hi> 12. proteſts, that he heard of one of credit, that one was taken with madneſs the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year after the poiſon was received; yea, <hi>Alzaharavius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that he found by experience this poiſon to have lain lurking in the Body Forty years.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons which may induce us to believe this to be true are ſundry. Firſt, the variety of the parts offended: As for example: If a Nerve, Vein, or Artery be hurt, the poiſon may more prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be communicated by theſe conduits to the noble parts, from whence they ſpring, than by other parts ignobler, which have no ſuch conſent with them. The Second, is the nature of the poiſon it ſelf, which ſometimes is ſtronger, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weaker, and ſo more or leſs active. The Third, is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſtrength of the party bitten: and ſo if ſundry perſons about the ſame time be bitten by the ſame Dog or Wolf, neither do they all ſuſtain the like harm, neither do the Symptomes appear about the ſame time in all, becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſome are ſtronger, and of ſome weaker to reſiſt the poiſon.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is, becauſe the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is more fierce in one Beaſt, than in another: and ſo two being bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by two ſeveral Dogs, the one may ſooner die than the other, by reaſon of the vehemencie of the poiſon. Fifthly, the ſeaſon of the year, and the conſtitution of the climate may much further, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Symptomes: And ſo the poiſon of Serpents in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in the Summer time is moſt fierce. Sixthly and laſtly, the Diet of the diſeaſed party may much further or hinder the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Symptomes: for if he uſe a Diet which abates the force of the poiſon, they muſt of a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appear more ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>That the Dog that bit is mad, you ſhall know by theſe ſigns; A mad Dog doth refuſe both Food and Drink; much ſlaver iſſues out of his Mouth and Noſtrils: He looks wild, his Eies are red and fiery: he barks but little, and that hoarſly: he becomes lean: he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Tail under his Belly: he hangs his Tongue out of his Mouth, which appears either Yellow, as if it were dried with choler, or black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, or reddiſh: other Dogs ſhun them: ſometimes they run main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes they ſtand ſtill: in running oftentimes they ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Trees or Blocks: He knows not his owner, but runs fierc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly upon all indifferently.</p>
                     <p>If we cannot have the Dog to examine whether he be mad or no, Authors have ſet down ſome means to find this out by the Wound it ſelf. The Firſt is, we are to beat ſome Walnuts, and to apply them to the Wound, and to ſuffer them to lie to it for a nights ſpace: when they are taken away, they are to be given to a Cock or a Hen. If the Dog hath not been mad, they ſhall live; but if he was mad, they ſhall die the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Secondly, others lay Wheat to the Wound: others draw Blood and Quittour from the Wound, and adding to it flower make a paſte, which they give to a Hen; If the Dog was mad, the Hen dies. Thirdly, <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Rhaſes</hi> adviſe us to rub the Wound with the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52816:165"/>crum of a loaf, that it may imbibe the Blood and Quittour of the Wound, and to offer it to a Dog; if the Dog refuſe to eat it, or to ſmell unto it; and if after eating of it he become mad or die, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kely that the Dog was mad.</p>
                     <p>Having ſet down the means by which we may find out whether a Dog which hath bitten a perſon, was mad; it is requiſite alſo that I ſet down the Signs by which you may find out, whether the party bitten is like to be mad.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of madneſs beginning are theſe: The party becomes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and angry without any juſt cauſe; he feels a gnawing and heavineſs in the Stomach: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of unſeaſonable weather, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be fair, his Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes heavy and lumpiſh: he is given to watching; and if he do ſleep, his ſleep is troubleſome, he fears without cauſe: he drinks leſs than he was wont: he begins to murmure, and to ſpeak to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he deſires Candle-light by day: In the part wounded, thô skinned, a pain will be felt, which mounts up towards the Head: whither when it is come, a giddineſs is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the party cannot walk ſteadily forward. When theſe laſt ſigns appear, be aſſured that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſs is at hand.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſigns of madneſs confirmed: the Face and Body become red: the party becomes troubleſome, he foams at the Mouth, he hath wild looks, he ſpits upon thoſe which ſtand by: amongſt ſuch perſons ſome do bark like Dogs, and offer to bite: It is common to all thoſe who become and by the biting of a mad Dog, to hate water, and all liquid things: the true cauſe of this, is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy between this poiſon and liquid things: for by ſuch things it becomes more fierce, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed parties are more offended, the Pulſes of ſuch are ſmall, and inordinate: their Members become more and more lumpiſh; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come coſtive: Their Urine comes away by dropping: their voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hoarſe: they are troubled with difficulty of breathing; they put out their Tongues; when the grief increaſes they vomit either yellow or black Choler: A day or two before they die, ſome of them are troubled with the Hicket, and a little before death with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and a fearful gnaſhing of the Teeth.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of ſuch Wounds, receive theſe: Firſt, if the Wound be not deep, and hath not offended a Nerve, Vein or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, there is great hope that it may be cured, if Art be uſed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the party bitten become mad and fear water, there is ſmall, or rather no hope of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon is to ſet three Intentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eies: Firſt, that he labour by all means to draw the poiſon out of the Wound, that it go not deeper into the Body. Secondly, the principal parts are to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, that they may the better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and repell the poiſon. The Third is, that he labour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the malignity of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt he ſhall attain to, if firſt he apply a Ligature three or four Inches above the Wound; yet

                        <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. will not have this Ligature to be too ſtrait, leſt the part be benummed: But if the part will not admit a Ligature, then is he to apply a Defenſive to the parts adiacent made of Bole, <hi>Terra ſigillata, Sangu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s dracenis</hi> and ſuch like; tempered with the whites of Eggs. Secondly, he is to ſcarifie the Wound, if it be not large enough already, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Cupping-glaſſes with a large flame to make the ſtronger attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: If the part cannot be cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, yet it is always to be ſcarified, and the Blood to be drawn by a dry Sponge, not wet in water. Thirdly, it is not amiſs to pull the feathers from the vents of Hens or Cocks, and to apply them often to the wounded part, or to apply young Pigeons or Chickens hot being cut aſunder.</p>
                     <p>After this he is to apply attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive local Medicaments, as cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms made of Garlick, Onions, Pigeons-dung, Muſtard, Walnuts, Treacle, Rue, Leaven, Salt and Honey. <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de antidot. c.</hi> 1. highly commends an Emplaſter made of Pitch, <hi>Opopanax,</hi> and Vinegar, and affirms that he never ſaw any that died, unto whom this Emplaſter was applied: the compoſition is this: ℞ <hi>Picis</hi>

                     <p>Bleeding is not to be uſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it weakens the Patient, and ſtirs the poiſon.</p>
                     <p>Purgation in like manner in the beginning is not convenient; for it is like that it will draw the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the inward parts: If the poiſon hath poſſeſſed the inner parts, then it will not be amiſs to uſe evacuation ſundry times before the 40th day be expired: for Wounds cauſed by the biting of mad Dogs, muſt be kept open 40 days at the leaſt.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hildanus Obſ. Chirurg.</hi> 78. <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. relates, how <hi>Anno</hi> 1602. <hi>Jul.</hi> 30. a young Man was wounded in the Arm by the bite of a mad Dog, and cured.
<q>The young Man (ſays he) came to me the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Firſt of all I ſcarified the bite, and applyed a Cupping-glaſs with much flame, and extracted as much Blood as I could: Then I waſhed all the Arm in <hi>Poſca,</hi> wherein Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and a little Sea-Salt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. For the ſlaver of a mad Dog, if it drie upon any part of the Skin, unleſs it be quickly and carefully waſhed, and wiped off, may cauſe madneſs. After this I cauterized the bite all over ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep with an actual Cautery. And by the way I would adviſe young Chirurgeons to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care, that they cauterize not ſuch bites only ſuperficially, but rather to erre in exceſs than in defect. For ſince it is a deſperate Diſeaſe, it muſt have a deſperate Cure: I ſpeak by experience; For the Daughter of <hi>Sebaſtian Cuiſner</hi> received no benefit by an old Womans applying a Cautery to her; becauſe it was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed deep enough. But to the caſe in hand. After burning, I was not ſo very ſolicitous to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the pain; becauſe unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, and ſuch as relax the Eſchar, as Butter, Oil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (much leſs cooling and repelling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments) are not much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by me in ſuch Ulcers. For they hinder the evaporation of venome, and theſe repell the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52816:167"/>Blood, and with it the venome to the noble parts. But ſince pain (as <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifies) attracts the Blood and Humors out of the Body to it ſelf, it is probable that pain, if moderate, may do good in ſuch Ulcers. Therefore after burning I applied Cotton wet in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> wherein Treacle was diſſolved, to the Ulcer. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I laid the following Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to it, ſpread upon a Cloth. ℞ <hi>Cep. aliquantùm ſub prunis coct. Ferment. Farin. Sinap. an.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Theriac.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>fol. Rut. Scord. an. M. ſs. Miſceantur in Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, addendo parum mellis.</hi> The next day I cut the Eſchar every where, as much as might be, then I repeated the applications of the foreſaid Medicines: and ſo I proceeded, till the fall of the Eſchar. Afterwards, leſt the lips of the Ulcer might cloſe, I put Peaſe in it twice a day, as we do in Iſſues, and applied the preſcribed Plaſter: And thus I kept open the Ulcer for three Months. Yet in the <hi>interim</hi> twice or thrice a week I ſtrewed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Powder upon the Ulcer; ℞ <hi>Pulv. praecip. lap. Bezoardic. pulv. rad. Angel. an.</hi> ℈ j. <hi>Miſce.</hi> For it wonderfully attracts the malignity from within to it ſelf. Inwardly I gave Alexipharmacks, Treacle, Mithridate, burnt Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Bezoar, and the following powder in Bugloſs and Borage water, which is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by ancient and modern Phyſicians. ℞ <hi>Ciner.

Pulvis ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſſimus.</hi> I neither Bled nor Purged him, leſt I ſhould draw the Poiſon inward. Thus by Gods bleſſing he was cured, and continues well till this day. By the ſame means I cured this young man's Brother, who was bitten by the ſame Dog, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in health a whole year after; and then died of a Pleuriſie.</q>

I mean not to inſiſt on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of every one of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, the Symptoms which enſue after the Biting, and the manner of Cure, becauſe it would be a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labour, the Land being free from them, and ſo from their harm. In this Country only the Adder, and the Slow-worm are found, which oftentimes do great hurt. Of theſe then I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as alſo of the Toad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here is great ſtore of them, and their Poiſon is able to procure Death.</p>
                     <p>I will firſt deal with the Adder. It is called <hi>Coluber</hi> in Latin, either <hi>quia colit umbras,</hi> becauſe it haunts ſhadowy places, or <hi>à lubricis tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus,</hi> from her winding pace or path. It is long like an Eel, black on the Back, having yellow ſpots on the Belly: the Head is more flat than the Snake's Head. It is a crafty and venemous Serpent, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuddenly thoſe that paſs by: whereupon <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Teſtament, or laſt Will, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>v.</hi> 17. calls <hi>Dan,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who was of that Tribe, <hi>coluber in vià,</hi> an Adder in the way.</p>

                        <hi>Ambroſ. Pareus, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 23. ſhews how he cured one bitten by an Adder: becauſe the Hiſtory is memorable, I thought good to ſet it down.
<q>At what time (ſaith he) <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth lay at <hi>Melines,</hi> I and Doctor <hi>le Fure,</hi> the Kings Phyſician, were ſent for to cure a Cook of the Lady of <hi>Gaſtroperſes,</hi> who was bitten by an Adder, as he was gathering wild Hops in a Hedge. The Cook as ſoon as he was bitten in the Hand, ſucked the Wound with his Mouth, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to mitigate the pain, and draw out again the Poiſon. But as ſoon as the Tongue touched the Wound, preſently it ſo ſwelled that he could not ſpeak. Beſides this his Arm even to the Shoulder blade did ſwell, and cauſed ſuch ſharp pain, that he ſwooned twice while I was by him, his countenance becoming yellowiſh, and of a livid colour like to a dead man: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did deſpair of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the man, yet I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him not, but waſhed his Mouth with Treacle diſſolved in white Wine, and miniſtred it to him, adding <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> I ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the Arm with many and deep ſcarifications I ſuffered the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52816:169"/>Blood which was wateriſh and ſanious to flow plentifully from the parts about the ſore; I waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcarifications with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate and Treacle, diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Vitae:</hi> the ſick Perſon I laid in his warm bed, and cauſed him to ſweat, but forbade him to ſleep, leſt the Poiſon ſhould have been drawn to the inner parts. By theſe means I ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that the next day all the malign Symptoms ceaſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to finiſh the Cure I thought good that the Wound ſhould be long kept open and waſhed with Treacle: Neither was I deceived, for within a few days he recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By it you may obſerve, that whether Poiſon be inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or externally impreſſed, it is good to watch untill the force of the Poiſon be abated, leſt it ſeiſe upon the inward part.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They who catch Adders, apply the Powder of them to the part affected, if they be bitten, and take this ſame Powder inwardly; as they who catch Vipers uſe the Powder and Trochiſcs of Vipers. Others commend the Powder of Tin, and commend it as a ſecret and ſpecifical Medicament. But the Method ſet down by me is the ſafeſt way to cure: If you would make trial of the Powders of Adders, or Tin, I would adviſe you to mingle them with <hi>Theriaca.</hi> Now a days the Adder and Viper-Wines are in great requeſt: But a Queſtion may be moved, whether they be wholeſome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolaus Florentin.</hi> 1. <hi>de Venen.</hi> following <hi>Rabbi Moſes,</hi> and others, writes that Viper-Wine being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten drunk, is effectual againſt Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Epid. Text.</hi> 5. affirms both Wine, and Viper the Fleſh to be good againſt Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: So that Viper-Wine by theſe Mens Judgments, cannot but be good for healthful perſons. When I travelled in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> I obſerved that the Earl of <hi>Roſenberg</hi> the younger, during the Summer time did eat the fleſh of Adders, for preſerving the ſight, and ſtaying of old Age: But <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and others give advice that care be had, that Serpents be not ſuffered to have acceſs to Wine Veſſels, leſt they poiſon the Wine; which if they do, then ſurely the Wine is like to make a ſpeedy way for the Poiſon to aſſault the principal parts.</p>
                     <p>This doubt I think may be thus reſolved; If by chance Vipers or Adders be drowned in the Wine; becauſe the whole Body lieth in the Wine, neither Head, Tail, Guts nor Gall being taken away: and no time of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being granted, undoubtedly the Wine muſt be venomous: But if it be made by Art, theſe parts being taken away, and the fleſh well prepared, and fermentation permitted; ſuch a Wine muſt be wholeſome, if a skilful Phyſician, unto whom Diſeaſes and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are known, do order the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of taking it.</p>
                     <p>It is now time to come to the Slow-worm: it is called in Latin <hi>Coecilia</hi> and <hi>Coecula,</hi> becauſe it is blind; and by <hi>Nicander</hi>

                     <p>It is a little ſlender Serpent, it hath a hard Skin of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, For it is partly of a blewiſh, partly yellowiſh, partly of a light
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52816:169"/>purple between theſe: It hath ſmall Eyes, and covered with a thin Skin. It hath very ſmall Teeth, but more to be ſeen in the lower than upper Gum. Its Tongue is cloven: It hath a chink in the Belly, which being opened it layeth Eggs: after the Eggs are laid, the chink doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate again. They are in length about a ſpan, and about the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Mans Finger; towards the Tail it is more ſlender: The Female is more black than the Male: The paſſage of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and place of conception, is tranſverſe: It comes abroad in <hi>July:</hi> It is harmleſs, unleſs it be hurt: It is ſeen moſt often in hilly places: In the Winter it lies in the cliffs of Rocks, and cavities of the Ground. Storks do much prey upon them.</p>
                     <p>It is very venomous, the bitings of it are very ſmall, and ſcarce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The place bitten is red, and the whole Body becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure, you are to ſcarifie the part, and to apply a Ventoſe. Then you are to apply Mithridate, Treacle, or <hi>Terra ſigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I will conclude this Chapter with ſetting down of the Cure of the Poiſon of a Toad. In Latin it is called <hi>Bufo:</hi> The colour of it is blackiſh, mingled of black and a dark yellow; the black is bunched and full of knobs; the Skin is very thick; the Head is broad and thick, and the colour thereof about the Neck is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pale; the Heart is in the Neck, and therefore it is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be killed, unleſs the Neck be cut aſunder, or deeply pierced: Its Eyes are of a flaming yellow colour, like thoſe of a Goſhauk: It leaps not as Frogs, but creeps ſlowly, partly by reaſon of its ſhort Legs, partly by reaſon of its ſluggiſh Body; it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dumb; it couples not only with Toads of its own kind, but Frogs alſo; it delights in dry places, as in Stables, Dung, Beds in Gardens, and Caves of the Earth; it feeds upon the Slime of the Earth, Earthworms and Bees, which it draws out of the Hives by its venomous Breath: It delights much to be in places where Sage is planted. It not only infects all things over which it paſſes by its poiſonous piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but by beſpattering He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bs with its venomous ſlaver. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not to be wondred if Men die, who have eaten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares Herbs, Strawberries, and Muſhroms infected by Toads: If one do move it, it Swells, and looks ugly with flaming red Eyes, expecting opportunity to dart out virulent piſſing, and a white Juice out of the Mouth; yea, if it can touch one, it doth bite by the hard brims of the Lips: Being pricked thorow the middle, it will live ſome days; and from it will drop a bloody Poiſon mingled with a yellow Water.</p>
                     <p>The Enemies of the Toad are the Cat, the Polecat and Viper.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:52816:170"/>If one be infected with the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Toad, theſe Symptoms enſue.

As for Gun-powder, it is not venomous, whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider each Simple whereof it is made ſeverally, or them all jointly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52816:171"/>in the Compoſition: For firſt of all, the Brimſtone is not venomous, <hi>Galen.</hi> 9. <hi>ſimpl.</hi> 36. affirms it to be effectual againſt the Itch, and daily experience proves this to be true: It is good alſo in Diſeaſes of the Lungs, according to <hi>Dioſcorid. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 73. Saltpeter is uſed in the cure of burning Fevers, there is none ſuch a Novice in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſick, unto whom the faculties of <hi>Lapis Prunellae</hi> are not known; yea, it may be ſafely uſed inſtead of ordinary Salt to Meat. The Coles either of the Willow, or Stalks of Hemp are only dry, and have ſubtil ſubſtance, whereby they are eaſily ſet on Fire, by the Match or Sparkles of Fire. Neither is the whole compoſition Poiſon, as <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> are, whoſe ingredients, ſeverally uſed, are not venomous, for it may be miniſtred in Milk to kill Worms in Dogs or ſtrong Children; yea, the German Soldiers will drink it before they Fight; and it is good to be applied to Scald Heads. As for the Bullet, it is in like manner harmleſs; for the Powder made of it is good againſt malign Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and if it be beat out into a Plate, it will ſtay the increaſe of Tumors in the beginning: Beſides this, Bullets have lain long in the Bodies of ſome Perſons, not procuring any harm.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition: Such Wounds are never without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion in the Fleſh, ſeldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tearing of Tendons and Nerves, and often cauſe fractures in the Bones, by reaſon of the violence and blunt hard ſubſtance of the Bullets. This Propoſition needs no confirmation: for theſe effects offer themſelves to the Eye in theſe Wounds.</p>
                     <p>The third Propoſition: A Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let may be ſo made, that it may cauſe a poiſoned Wound: it is the Opinion of <hi>Quercetan, Tractat. de his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulneribus, c.</hi> 1. And it may be made good by three Reaſons: Firſt, Weapons made of Steel, the hardeſt of all Metals, may be made poiſoned: much more than Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets made of Lead or Tin, ſoft and porous Metals. That Steel Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons may be poiſoned, theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors witneſs: <hi>Homer.</hi> 1. <hi>Odyſſ. Theophraſt. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de hiſt. plant. c.</hi> 15. <hi>de Scythis idem affirmat. Plin. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 53. <hi>de Dabnatis &amp; Dacis. Aeginet. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 88. <hi>&amp; generaliter de Barbaris Dioſcorid. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Secondly, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us, that Metals may ſundry ways be altered by mingling ſome things with them, or quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in ſome Liquors: ſo Braſs is made of Copper, Lead may be hardned, and Tin may be cauſed to leave its crackling, and Copper be made white by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arſenick, and Iron may be hardned, if it be quenched in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and the Juice of the Radiſh, or Smith's Water: It will on the contrary be made ſoft, if it be quenched in the Juice of Hemlock, and common Mallows, if a little Soap be added. The third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this: poiſonous Spirits, and Oyls drawn from Minerals, may be mingled with Metals, ſo that they may participate of their venenoſity-Wherefore, if Bullets imbibe ſuch, if they ſtay long in the Body, doubtleſs they may cauſe a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Wound; for the heat which the Powder cauſes in the Bullet,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52816:171"/>is not able to ſeparate them: ſuch is the Oyl of Mercury ſublimate rectified from Arſenick: And though this be true, yet it is ſtrange that any Man ſhould think every Wound made by Gun-ſhot is poiſonous; ſeeing experience te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The differences of theſe Wounds are taken from the diverſity of the ſimilary parts which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de of it, as appears in chinks of the Scull; and <hi>Fruſtalis,</hi> when a bone is broken into ſmall pieces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſhivers. Now it is manifeſt that the third kind of fracture is moſt commonly ſeen, when a Bone is fractured by a Gun-ſhot; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtrument cauſing the fracture is blunt, and very forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>As for the Signs of theſe Wounds; they are taken firſt from the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: for theſe Wounds are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways orbicular: Secondly, from the colour, for the part is either of a livid colour, or of a blew colour mingled with green, or of a violet colour; ſometimes the Wound is black, and the adjacent parts livid: Thirdly, from the feeling of the Blow: for when one is wounded he feels as he thinks a Stone, or a piece of ſome heavy and blunt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument entering into the part. Fourthly, from little Blood iſſuing out: for the part being contuſed, the brims quickly afterward ſo ſwell very often, that Blood is ſtayed from flowing. Fifthly, from the heat of the part; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by reaſon of the quick and vehement paſſing of the Bullet, or grievous contuſion of the parts wounded. Sixthly, from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, as if burning appear: this is diſcerned, if Puſtules do appear, if a ſcorching heat, drineſs, wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hardneſs of the Skin, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cloaths do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſight; burning is cauſed if the piece be diſcharged not far from the wounded party. Theſe are the Signs of Wounds made by Gun-ſhot, if the Bullet be not poiſoned.</p>
                     <p>If the Bullet be poiſoned, theſe Signs will appear. Firſt, an ugly colour will appear, as if it tended to mortification. Secondly, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pain, and pricking. Thirdly, great inflammation. Fourthly, a heavineſs of the whole Body. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a ſharp Fever. Sixthly, Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Seventhly, Raving, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52816:172"/>if no evident Cauſe can be given for theſe Accidents. Eightly, the Bullet it ſelf will ſhew the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for if you put the Bullet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſublimatory Veſſel, and put a ſtrong Fire under it, a black ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmoak will riſe from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the upper part of it will be of a blackiſh or livid colour. If you cannot have the opportunity to do this, then cut the Bullet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; if it be poiſoned, it will be of a violet colour.</p>
                     <p>The Symptoms of ordinary Wounds made by Gun-ſhot are theſe; Contuſion, Pain, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Convulſion, Heat, Palſie, (if the Inſtruments appointed for Motion be torn) the natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the part altered, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Gangrene, and a Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if the Wound be great, and in or near to a Joint. If the Bullet be poiſoned, all theſe Signs and Symptoms will appear; but ſooner and more vehement, than if it were not. But becauſe I have diſcourſed of moſt of theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the general Doctrine of Wounds, I will remit you to the Chapter wherein they are handled; of a Gangrene and a Sideration, becauſe they are Symptoms which may enſue after all ſorts of Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Unity, I will handle them when I have ſpoken of Fractures and Luxations in their proper place.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks receive theſe, Firſt, if a fleſhy part be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, and the Conſtitution of the party be laudable, and the Air favourable, the Wound may be cured without any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Secondly, If the Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Parts be violently torn or broken, if the Temperature of the party be not laudable, but <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymical;</hi> if the Air be hot and moiſt, which falls out when the South-wind blows; and if Signs of Poiſon do appear, it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Gangrene and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will enſue. Thirdly, theſe Wounds yield a ſtinking <hi>Sanies,</hi> if the parts be much torn, and much Humor be ſent to the wounded part, which quenches the natural heat. Fourthly, theſe Wounds are harder to be cured than thoſe which are made by other Weapons, by reaſon of the Contuſion which ſtill doth accompany them. Fifthly, theſe Wounds come more ſlowly to Suppuration than others do; partly becauſe the natural Heat is much abated, and partly becauſe the Spirits are much diſſipated by reaſon of the great Contuſion.</p>
                     <p>It is now time to come to the cure of theſe Wounds. The firſt intention of cure is to remove from the Wound all extraneous Bodies, as the Bullets, pieces of Garments, Paper, pleces of Wood, or Metal, contuſed Fleſh, clotted Blood, ſhivers of Bones, and ſuch like: But ſeeing I have ſhewed in the third Chapter concerning this Subject, which I now have in hand, how extraneous Bodies are to be taken out of Wounds, let me deſire you to have recourſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                        <p>Of the means to avert Humors from the wounded Head.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AT laſt I am come to the laſt Point, whereof I intended to diſcourſe concerning Wounds; which is, the cure of the Wounds of particular Members, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qaire any ſpecial conſideration dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the canons of Wounds in general ſet down by me hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Theſe Wounds are either of the Ventricles, or Extremities, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mbs, the Ventricles are three, the Head, the Breaſt, and the lower B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y. Now Wounds of the Head either cauſe Solution of Unity in the very ſeat of the Brain, or in other parts appointed to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats of the Senſes. As for the Wounds, which are inflicted into the ſeat of the Brain, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hairy Scalp, they ſhall be diſpatched in ſetting down three Points. The firſt Point ſhall be ſpent in diſcourſing of theſe things which are common to moſt of theſe Wounds. The ſecond ſhall ſet down the particular explication of theſe Wounds. The third ſhall ſhew what ſymptoms enſue after fractures of the Scull.</p>
                     <p>The things which are common to moſt of theſe Wounds are in number four. Firſt, the averſion of the Humor from the wounded part. Secondly, the general Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks. Thirdly, the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fit Topicks, which are to be applied to aſſwage Pain, and ſtay any Inflammation. Fourthly, ſhall be ſet down the manner of Rolling.</p>
                     <p>Averſion of the Matter which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath already brought Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or is like to procure them, is performed by three means, to wit, by Blood Letting, Purging, and the right ordering of the ſix things not natural.</p>
                     <p>Phlebotomy is either univerſal or particular. The univerſal is performed by opening of a Vein. Of this kind of Phlebotomy theſe things may be demanded. Firſt, whether a Vein is to be opened, and Blood drawn? Secondly, how much Blood is to be drawn? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which Veins are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened?</p>
                     <p>As concerning the firſt demand, Blood ought to be drawn in three Caſes. Firſt, if a competent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood did not flow out of the Wound, when firſt it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Secondly, if it be a great Wound, and the party be ſtrong.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52816:174"/>Thirdly, if a great Inflammation hath invaded the part, or a Fever hath ſeiſed upon the party.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the quantity, Blood is drawn either ſo much at one time as is requiſite, or at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times. If you go about to draw ſo much Blood at one time as is requiſite, you are to ſtop the Vein. Firſt, when the Pulſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſmaller, and flower. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when a faint Sweat iſſues out at the Forehead. Thirdly, when the colour of the Face is changed, and the Lips grow pale. Fourthly, when a pain of the Heart doth draw on, with yawning, and a deſire to Vomit, or to go to Stool. If you are to draw Blood ſundry times for this ſame Grief, you muſt continue the doing of this, untill all ill Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as Inflammation and Fever ceaſe. See <hi>Parey lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. de Valner. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis, c.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Veins which are to be opened, you are to take thoſe of the ſame ſide, and thoſe muſt be either the veins of the Arm, or the Veins near to the wounded part, as the Vein of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Veins of the Temples, and thoſe which are under the Tongue. See <hi>Parey</hi> in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited.</p>
                     <p>A particular detraction of Blood is when we take Blood from the part affected. This is performed by ſcarifying the brims of the Wound, applying Ventoſes, or by laying to Leeches <hi>idem ibid.</hi> If the party be timorous, and loath to admit any kind of Bleeding, then you may uſe ſtrong frictions of the whole Body, with courſe Linnen Cloths, or of other parts of the Body, the Head excepted: for theſe will diſcuſs the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matter, and turn it into a <hi>halitus</hi> or Slime. For ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt increaſe, the wounded party omitting the accuſtomed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</p>
                     <p>As for Purging, it is procured three manner of ways: Firſt, by Cathartical Medicaments given by the Mouth. Secondly, by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Thirdly, by Suppoſitories. And as concerning ſolutive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments which are miniſtred by the mouth, theſe Points may be asked. Firſt, whether purging is to be uſed? Secondly, when ſuch Medicaments are to be exhibited? Thirdly, of what hidden faculty they muſt be? Fourthly, of what force they muſt be?</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt demand, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Medicament is to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in three Caſes. Firſt, if the party have the Head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As concerning the time which was the ſecond demand, Purgative Medicaments are to be miniſied in the beginning. Firſt, leſt ſtrength decreaſe. Secondly, leſt the Fever increaſe. Thirdly, to hinder the Humor ſtirred from aſcending to the Head. This <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As for the third demand, thoſe Medicaments which purge Choler, ſeem moſt fit in Wounds of the Head: Becauſe the Symptoms
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52816:174"/>which enſue after theſe Wounds, as Inflammations and Fevers, ſeem to be the effects of yellow Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
                     <p>As for the fourth demand, we are to ſhun ſtrong and eradicative Medicaments chiefly in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, leſt that by too ſtrong a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Humors, a Pain, a Fever, and Inflammation be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. See <hi>Parey lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. Wherefore we muſt uſe gentle Molicaments, and which do not increaſe heat. Such are the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or decoction of Myrobalans mingled with <hi>Electuarium Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi> or <hi>de ſucco Roſarum, aut Dieprunum Solutivum.</hi> The Doſe muſt not be great, you may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter alſo the infuſion of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rb, and Myrobalans, with the Syrup of Roſes ſolutive with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garick. Myrobalans ſtrengthen the Stomach and Head, as alſo the Veins.

                     <p>Having delivered ſo much as may ſeem ſufficient to clear the doubts which may ariſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bleeding and Purging: now am I to ſhew you how thoſe things which are called not natural, are to be ordered; for the obſervation of this Point doth greatly further the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, as concerning the Air, it ought to be temperate, and thick, according to <hi>Fallop. in Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. de Vulner. cap. c.</hi> 25. For a hot and thin Air doth eliquate and melt the Humors, and ſo makes them more apt for Fluxion. A cold Air is hurtful for the Brain, the Bones, the Nerves, and the <hi>Spinalis Medulla,</hi> or Marrow of the Back-bone. If then the Air prove cold, when you dreſs the Patient, hold at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a Chafing-diſh with Coals above the Head, to hinder the impreſſion of the cold Air. See <hi>Parey lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. Then apply the Medicaments being made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> then the room is to be cooled by hanging it with Sheets, and moiſtning them with cold Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, or you may garniſh the Windows with Medow-ſweet, Gaul, Burnet, Borage, Violets, Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that Wounds of the Head are ſooner and more ſafely cured in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in the Summer: and ſo concoct the Humors the better: whereas on the contrary, in the Summer time the Humors are apt to be made thin, Fuliginous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors are raiſed, and Inflammation doth invade.</p>
                     <p>As for the Meat and Drink, Wine is not to be granted before fourteen days be expired; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this ſpace all Symptoms uſually ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>In hot Regions where no Beer or Ale is, Barley Water is to be preſcribed. If the wounded party be of a queaſie Stomach, or weak or aged. Sugar may be added, or <hi>Oxyſaccharum,</hi> or the Syrup of

                     <p>If there be a Fracture, neither Fleſh nor Fiſh are to be permitted the firſt ſeven days.

If the wounded party eat of theſe boiled, then you may boil with them Spinach, Lettuce, Purſelain, Sorrel, Borage, Bugloſs, Endive and Succory; but if they will feed upon them roſted, then make Sip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets unto them of Verjuice, the Juice of Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Pomegranats, or Sorrel with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.

                     <p>Perturbations of the Mind are altogether to be abandoned; for the contraction and diſſipation of the Spirits cauſe great alteration of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Venery above all other things is to be ſhunned in Wounds of the Head, chiefly if there be a Fracture; and that not only while the Wounds are in curing, but alſo long after they are cured: for great ſtore of Spirits are contained in a ſmall quantity of the Seed, the greateſt part whereof flows from the Brain: Hence therefore all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but chiefly the Animal are reſolved and weakned. <hi>Parey</hi> in the place before quoted affirms, that he hath known death to have enſued in ſmall wounds of the Head (even when they have been cured) by reaſon of Venery.</p>
                     <p>As for the Excretion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, the Body muſt ſtill be kept ſoluble, leſt, if theſe ſhould be retained, corrupt and noiſome Vapors ſhould aſcend to the Head: wherefore if Nature be dull and ſlow, Evacuation muſt be procured by Suppoſitories and Clyſters.

                     <p>This happens either becauſe the Air is hurtful by its elementary quality only, as when it is cold and moiſt, as in <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Bononia,</hi> according to <hi>Amat.

                     <p n="3">3. Wounds of the Head recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by perſons who have the Pox, Leproſie, Dropſie, a Cough of the Lungs, a Hectick Fever, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or ill habit of Body, are hardeſt to be cured; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Blood is not ſit for uniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being corrupt, as in the Pox and Leproſie; partly becauſe there is not a ſufficient ſtore of it, as in a Hectick, and Extenuation of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wounds of the Head in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prove ſometimes rebellious; partly becauſe they are of a hot and moiſt conſtitution, which is moſt apt to admit putrefaction; partly becauſe the habit of their Body is thin, and ſo miniſtreth occaſion to the breathing out of the Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In deadly Wounds of the Head, the parties live longer in the Winter, than in the Summer: for in it unnatural heat is not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed as in the Summer.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If in Wounds of the Head a

                     <p n="8">8. If a Fever in theſe Wounds do appear the Eleventh or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, with a cold and groo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p n="9">9. Wounds contuſed are more flowly cured, than thoſe which are ixiſed, becauſe they require great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Suppuration.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Symptoms do ſooner appear in the Summer, than in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for in the Summer we look for them the Seventh or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Summer the Humors admit ſooner putrefaction, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat being more readily ſtirred up. <hi>Vide Hippocrat.</hi> 1. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is an ill ſign, if the fleſh of the brims look livid, for that is a ſign of the decay of natural heat: <hi>See Hippoc. Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. If in Wounds of the Head Reaſon fail, if Speech ceaſe, if Sight be loſt, if the party labour to tumble out of the Bed, when he is not able to move the parts of his Body, if he have a continual Fever, if his Tongue be black and dry, if the brims of the Wound be blackiſh or dry, if he have an Apoplexy, Palſie, with an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary excretion of his Excrements, or an abſolute ſuppreſſion of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Urine, a Phrenſie, or Convulſion, then you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce death to attend at the Door.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Wounds of the fore-part of the Head, are more dangerous than thoſe of the hinder-part. Firſt, becauſe greater ſtore of Brain is contained in the part. Secondly, becauſe the containing parts are thinner there. Thirdly, becauſe the <hi>Meninges</hi> have Sinuoſities or Cels in the fore-part, but not in the back-part: wherefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality cannot but endanger the Membranes, which cover the Brain, to be offended, if the Wound paſs thorow the Scull, or if the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan be to be applied. Fourthly, becauſe if Wounds of theſe parts be deadly, he who hath a deadly wound in the fore-part of the Head, dieth ſooner than he that hath a deadly Wound in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-part. Fifthly, becauſe more noxious Matter may be gathered in the fore-part, which may offend the Brain, than in the hinder-part, by reaſon of the multiplicity of the Cells. Sixthly, becauſe the fore-part hath more Sutures than the hinder-part. See <hi>Fallop. in Hippocrat. de vulner. capitis, cap.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Wounds of the Temples are very dangerous, Firſt, becauſe the motion of the joint of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Jaw, while we ſpeak, eat, or drink, doth hinder unition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the paſſage of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52816:177"/>Hearing is in the Temples: now the inſtruments of the Senſes are very ſenſible. Thirdly, becauſe veſſels of Moment, as the branches of the jugular veins, and ſoporal Arteries are diſtributed there: Fourthly, becauſe the temporal Muſcle is placed in the Temple, whoſe offence is not to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. de cap. vulnerib. c.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. A Wound in a Suture is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Firſt, becauſe the Scull is there parted, and ſo more apt to opening than one ſolid Bone. Secondly, becauſe in the Suture there is a Ligament, by which the <hi>Memnges</hi> are tied to the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="16">16. Blackneſs in the parts near to the Wound, a Convulſion, Palſie, loſs of Appetite, much watching, and coldueſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Body, portend an evil event.</p>

                     <p n="18">18. Fleſh is eaſily regenerate in all wounds of the Head, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe wherein there is a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Scull a little above the Eye-brows: Three reaſons may be yielded for this: Firſt, becauſe in thoſe places there is a Cavity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two tables of the Scull, which paſſes to the Sieve-like bones of the Noſe, full of Air, by which the generation of fleſh is hindred; for if you cauſe him, who hath a Wound with a fracture, there to breath ſtrongly, his Mouth and Noſtrils being ſhut, the breath which comes out at the Wound will blow out a reaſonable Candle held to it. Secondly, becauſe the thickneſs of the Bone will not ſuffer ſo much bloudy juice to breath out, as is ſufficient for the generation of fleſh. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a great affluxion of Excrements to the part, which otherwiſe would be diſcharged by the Eies and Noſe, which hinder the deſiccation of the Wound, and ſo cicatrization. <hi>Vid. Par. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. In wounds of the Head you may hope well, if the Patient hath no Fever, if he be in his right mind, if he finds himſelf well when he takes any thing, if he ſleep well, and have his Body ſoluble, if the Wound look with a freſh and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colour, if it yield laudable Quittour, and if in fractures the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> hath its motion free, and be not diſcoloured.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. In wounds of the Head with a fracture, we muſt not think that danger is paſt before an hundred daies be expired.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The <hi>Callus,</hi> whereby the parts of the Scull are united, thô it be ſooner induced in young, than in old perſons; yet moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is procured in the ſpace of 40 or 50 daies.</p>
                     <p>The Third common point to be obſerved in Wounds of the Head, I affirmed to be the appointing of Topicks fit for the aſſwaging of pain, and the removing and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of an Inflanmmation. Sundry
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:52816:177"/>Authors have ſet down ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of ſuch Medicaments, which if one ſhould gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſet down, a reaſonable Book might be compiled.</p>
                     <p>To avoid tediouſneſs, and not to leave you altogether unfurniſhed without the deſcription of any ſuch effectual Medicament, I will ſet down the Receipts of ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments which will anſwer your expectation, and eaſe the Patient.</p>

                     <p>The Third ſhall be this: ℞ <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullae panis albi</hi> ℥ iiij. <hi>lactis recen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> ℥vj. <hi>coq. iſta. ad cataplaſmatis conſiſtentiam, tandem adae un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenti popul.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>croci pulv.</hi> ℈ ij. This Cataplaſm is effectual, if the Inflammation and Pain be great, if the party be of a dry and hot Complexion, or be any way Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh. Theſe Cataplaſms are to be applied above the Medicaments wherewith the Wound is dreſt, the hairy Scalp having been ſhaven for a reaſonable compaſs about the Sore or Wound.</p>
                     <p>The laſt general point concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all wounds of the Head, ſet down by me, was of dreſſing up of the Head after the application of the Medicaments. In the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing two things are to be obſerved; the covering of the Head, and the rolling: As for the covering, A Cap muſt be made of a ſoft Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-cloth, baſted with fine Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons Tow, but not quilted; and it muſt be of that bigneſs, that it may compaſs the whole Head: it muſt not be too thick, too heavy, or too hard; becauſe the Head requires light, ſoft, and eaſie applications; yea, Topicks which are applied to Wounds of the Head muſt not be ſtubborn, as firm Emplaſters; nor too viſcous: becauſe the Firſt will cauſe pain, and the Second will not eaſily be taken off.</p>
                     <p>As for the rolling, it differs from the rolling of other parts becauſe the Head is ſomewhat ſpherical or round.</p>
                     <p>Of the Rollers theſe doubts may be propoſed; Firſt, of what Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ought to be made? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of what breadth and length they ought to be? Thirdly, of what Figure they ought to be? And laſtly, what mediocrity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction is to be uſed in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them?</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:52816:178"/>
                     <p>As for the Firſt, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, the matter whereof the Rollers are to be made; it ought to be of Flax and not of Wooll, becauſe it would be too hot, and cauſe itching, which inconveniences would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Patient. The Linnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth whereof the Rollers are to be made, muſt not be too new, for then it would be ſomewhat too rough; nor too old, for then it would be ſubject to tearing: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought it to be too thick, for then it would be heavy and boiſterous, nor too thin, for then it would be too weak.</p>
                     <p>As for the Second doubt, the Rollers ought to be three Inches in breadth, and of a Fathom and an half in length, or of ſuch a length as is ſufficient to compaſs the whole Scalp after manifold Circumvolutions and Rollings; for the Roller muſt keep on the local Medicaments, and make ſome conſtriction of the Head.</p>
                     <p>As for the figure of the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, they muſt have two ends, that when they meet they may by natural linking be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and kept from ſlipping.</p>
                     <p>As for the mean of Conſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be uſed in applying the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (which was the laſt doubt:) The Roller ought not to be too looſe; for then it could neither keep to the Medicaments, nor any way bind the Head: Neither ought it to be too ſtrait, for then theſe inconveniences might follow: Firſt, the pulſation of the Arteries would be intercepted. Secondly, fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Exhalations could not breath thorow the Sutures. Thirdly, the Blood would be driven from the wounded part to the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain, from the outward to the inward parts: from whence would enſue Pain, Inflammation, a Fever, Apoſtemation, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, Palſie, Apoplexy, and laſt of all Death. Neither wonder at this; for <hi>Galen. lib. de Faſciis,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that one by too ſtrait deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Head, loſt both his Eies; howſoever, great skill and circumſpection is required to dreſs the Wounds of the Head artificially.</p>

                        <p>Of Wounds of the parts placed above the Skull.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving ſet down thoſe points which concern all Wounds of the Head in general, I muſt now according to my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſcend to the handling of every particular Wound of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Head either of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the parts containing, or the parts contained alſo. The parts containing are either common or proper. The common parts are theſe, the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and the <hi>Panniculus carnoſus.</hi> The proper containing parts are theſe; The <hi>Muſcles,</hi> the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and the <hi>Cranium.</hi> The parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Cranium</hi> are ſubject to theſe offences, a Contuſion, a Wound, and a Contuſion with a Wound.</p>
                     <p>A Contuſion is cauſed by a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and obtuſe, or a blunt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a Cudgel, or by a fall from an high place, the Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting upon ſome blunt Body: It is diſcovered by the Tumor without a Wound, and often a blackneſs or blewneſs: If the Blood, by the violence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, be poured out between the Skin and the ſubjacent parts, it is called <hi>Ecchymoſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Contuſion without effuſion of Blood be preſented unto you, ſhave the Hair, and apply this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament: ℞ <hi>Albumen ovi unius, ol. myrt. &amp; pulv. myrtin. an.</hi> ℥ ſs. <hi>Miſc.</hi> This Medicament is to be uſed until the part come to its own temperature and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <p>So you ſee, that repelling and aſtrictive Medicaments are in this caſe firſt to be applied: For Firſt, by theſe means Veins and Arteries are ſtraitned, and cloſed up. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Defluxion is hindred. Thirdly, the part it ſelf is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.

                     <p>In great Contuſions ſometimes Gangrenes enſue, by reaſon of the extinction of the natural heat, which you ſhall conjecture if the part grow hard, and become to be of a livid and black colour; then thus you muſt go to work: Firſt, the part is to be ſcarified. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Cupping-glaſſes, or Horns, are to be applied. Thirdly, ſuch Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Topicks are to be applied, as are preſcribed for a Gangrene, whereof I mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in a particularity, when I have made an end of Fractures and Luxations; for it is a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, which moſt commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſolutions of Unity of all ſorts. It ſhall ſuffice to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much concerning a Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the parts placed above the Skull, now it follows, that we diſcourſe of Wounds of the ſame parts.</p>
                     <p>Wounds then in the parts above the skull, are of two ſorts: for in ſome of them the Skull is not laid bare, and in ſome of them it is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. You ſhall know that the Skull is not bared, partly, by the Finger: if the Wound be large enough; partly by the Probe, if no hard ſubſtance can be felt, and if the Probe ſlip and ſlide, meeting with the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> As for ſuch Wounds the obſervations, which I ſet down in the point concerning the general Cure of Wounds, will ſuffice for the curing of theſe.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, Wounds in the temporal Muſcle require a ſpecial conſideration, by reaſon of the fearful Symptomes, which enſue ſometimes after it is wounded. The temporal Muſcle then may be wounded three manner of ways: Firſt, by a puncture: Secondly, by being divided tranſverſly: And Thirdly, by being wounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length.</p>
                     <p>If the puncture be deep, or the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52816:179"/>tranſverſe Wound in like manner, it is a dangerous Wound, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The temporal Maſcle being out athwart, it loſes its proper action, which is to move and lift up the lower Jawe; and then the oppoſite temporal Muſcle, being ſound and whole, uſing its ſtrength the wounded Muſcle not being able to uſe any reſiſtance, it draws the lower Jaw to it; whereby the Mouth, and all parts of the Face are drawn awry, and ſuffer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion towards the found part, the other being reſolved and falling; for as often as the Muſcles of one kind are equal in number, bigneſs, and ſtrength on each ſide, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the one part cauſeth the Convulſion of the other.

                     <p>If the temporal Muſcle be wounded according to the length, then when you are called, you are to perform two offices; Firſt, if the Hemorrhage be of moment, then you are to ſlay the bleeding, and then you are to unite the brims by ordinary ſtitching. If the bleeding will not be ſtaied by the application of ordinary means, (whereof I have ſet down ſome choice in a proper place) then you are to paſs a needle through the muſculous Fleſh into the Wound, and from thence to the outward part of the Wound, compaſſing the great veſſels with a double thread in the needle: between the thread and the veſſels you are to put a little doſil of Lint, to ſhun the cutting aſunder of the parts
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52816:180"/>compaſſed with the thread, and to avoid pain. This being done, caſt a decent knot upon the thread, before you ſow the Wound; Firſt, cleanſe the Wound from the gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or clotted Blood, and all extraneous Bodies, and then few it, leſt the part wounded be cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Air, and a Convulſion do enſue: when you have dreſſed the party, let his Head be raiſed ſomewhat high with a Pillow.</p>
                     <p>It follows now, that I ſpeak of wounds of the parts above the Skull, wherein the Skull is detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or laid bare. In theſe Wounds the Skull is either not hurt, or hurt. If the Skull be not hurt, the Wound may be cured two manner of ways, to wit, by Agglutination, or by Incarnation: If you mean to cure the Wound by Agglutination, go thus to work: Firſt, ſtitch the Wound according to Art, then apply Pledgets moiſtned in the white of an Egg. The next day anoint the brims of the Wound with <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment, or ſome good Balſame, warmed in a ſpoon; uſe neither Tents nor Pledgets: for theſe hinder conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidation. If the Wound yield much Quittour, dreſs it twice a day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Quittour abate; continue this manner of dreſſing until the Wound be agglutinate, which will fall out ſometimes the fourth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſixth day. See <hi>Arcaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. If you intend to cure ſuch a Wound by Incarnation, or filling of the ſolution of the Unity by ingendring new fleſh: Firſt, beſprinkle the Bone with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick powder ſet down by me before. Secondly apply dry Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; Thirdly, fill up the Wound with ſome Sarcotical Unguent, as <hi>Aureum, Baſilicum,</hi> or <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment. It is far better to cure ſuch Wounds by Agglutination, than by Incarnation; for the ſcar will be leſs, and the cure will be finiſhed in a ſhorter time.</p>
                     <p>If the Skull be hurt, it falls out three manner of waies. Firſt, if it be made extraordinary dry by reaſon of the Air, which will fall out, if the Skull lie bare two hours. Secondly, if the upper portion of the <hi>Cranium</hi> be divided from the lower, and cleave to the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa.</hi> Thirdly, if both the Tables of the Skull be cut, and cleave to the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa,</hi> not ſeparate altogether from the parts adjacent. If the Scull hath become dry ſuperficially only, which you ſhall perceive if it bleed not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcraped with a Raſpatory; this upper <hi>Superficies</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with the Raſpatory, that Blood may come from the found Bone: then the Wound is to be ſtitched, and the cure to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Agglutination. If on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a portion of the <hi>Cranium</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the reſt, ſtick to the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis muſculoſa,</hi> it is to be takena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Wound to be cured either by Agglutination, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, as you ſhall ſee cauſe. If a portion of the whole <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> be divided from the reſt, ſo that the <hi>Dura mater</hi> offers it ſelf to the view, and ſticks to the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa,</hi> that portion is not to be ſeparated from the <hi>Cutis muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſa,</hi> leſt the Brain be deprived of its cover: but muſt be reduced into its place, and there kept, by bringing together the brims of the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa</hi> with ſo many
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:52816:180"/>deep and ſtrong ſtitches as ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>I cured a Warrener of Mr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s of the <hi>Verdry,</hi> Thirty two years ago, of ſuch a Wound, by theſe means within a few daies. Bones of the Head will ſuffer uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſeparate, as well as Bones of other parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>At laſt I am come to the Third kind of Wounds, which happens to parts placed above the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which is a Wound with a contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of this ſort of Wounds there be two kinds; For either they are ordinary or extraordinary. Theſe I call ordinary, which are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſtrange Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes: Such Wounds thus you ſhall dreſs. Firſt, you ſhall waſh and ſoment the Wound with the ſpirit of Wine; having drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf the tincture of Myrrh and Frankincenſe. Then if the Wound be great, ſtitch it with Needles: If it be not great a dry ſtick will ſerve. Dreſs the Wound either with <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment, or ſome good artificial vulnerary Balſame warmed. If the Wound be deep, a Tent muſt be kept in the depending part until it yield laudable Quittour, and then it is to be taken out: Then an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter is to be applied: <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum de gratiâ Dei</hi> will ſerve the turn.</p>
                     <p>An extraordinary Wound is ſuch an one as is accompanied with ſtrange, and unaccuſtomed Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes: ſuch are a Fever, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the whole Head, Neck, and Shoulders; as alſo the Breaſt: the brims of the Wound ſwell much, and are of a livid colour. The Wound caſts forth a virulent, ſharp, black, and ſtinking <hi>Sanies,</hi> The party feels a great and pricking pain: Such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents commonly enſue after the bitings of Men or Beaſts, which impreſs a malignity into the Wound.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a caſe two things are to be done: Firſt of all the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be drawn out. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſcarifying deeply the brims of the Wound, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying either Leeches or Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes. Then the Wound is to be waſhed and fomented with this Medicament: ℞ <hi>Theriac. Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machi</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. <hi>Mithridat.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, in ſuch Wounds you are to ſtrengthen the principal parts, (that they may be the more able to repel all malign vapours) with cordial Medicaments.

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the laſt Chapter I delivered unto you the method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Wounds as may happen in thoſe parts which are placed and lie above the Scull; now I am to ſhew how ſolutions of unity in the <hi>Cranium</hi> or the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ull it ſelf are to be handled. A ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unity in the Scull is by all practicers called a Fracture by a peculiar denomination.</p>
                     <p>I will firſt ſet down the things which are common either to all or moſt Fractures, and then thoſe things which are to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every Fracture in ſpecial. The things common are two, to wit, the ſigns of a Fracture, and the Preſages.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſigns, they are either found out by the Senſe, or conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured by Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Senſe, (if the Fracture be not preſented to the view at the firſt) doth find out a Fracture by two inſtruments, to wit, the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if the Wound be large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and I a Probe. If then you perceive either by your Finger or a Probe an inequality, depreſſion or ruggedneſs in the Scull, you may ſuſpect that there is a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Ruggedneſs may deceive you, if the Sutures of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party do vary from the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if the ſagittal Suture do reach to the <hi>Oſſa cribriformia</hi> or Sieve-like Bones of the Noſe. Some Idiots imagine the Sculls of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this point to differ from the Sculls of Men: but their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is erroneous: for this event is rare in either of both. That the Suture may deceive one. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrat.

Every wound of the Head ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Fracture is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, although no fearful Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome doth at the firſt for many daies appear and diſcover it ſelf: for the ſtrength of the party, the uncleanneſs of the Body, an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Diet, and the wholſomeneſs and temperateneſs of the Climat, are able to ſtay for a long time the appearing of ill accidents.</p>

Theſe Symptomes, if they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even quickly after that the wound is received, they ſhew that the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf is hurt: But if they appear about the Fourteenth day, or after, they proceed from the Inflammation of the Brain, and a Phlegmon of the ſame, by reaſon of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of putrefied Blood upon it.

                     <p>If there be a Wound with a Fracture, but no fearful ſymptom, <hi>Arcaeus</hi> will have no ſhiver, or part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> taken, if the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it cleave together; but only the Fracture to be anointed with his Liniment warmed, and applied by three or four Feathers ſtripped, until you come within an Inch of the points of them, and tied together with a thread.</p>
                     <p>If fearful Symptomes, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, a Fever, vomiting of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or a Palſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do appear, which ſhew an offence to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Brain by the <hi>Cranium,</hi> then it is requiſite that the Scull be opened. <hi>Vule Lang ep.</hi> 5. <hi>tem.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Fallop. in Hippoc. de vuln. cap. c.</hi> 47.</p>
                     <p>The Scull being opened, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are no other ways to be dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than Men are. How they are to be dreſſed, I will ſhew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It ſhall ſuffice then to have ſpoken ſo much concerning the cure of Fractures in the Sculls of Children.</p>
                     <p>Now I will declare unto you how theſe are to be cured in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ripe age. In handling of this matter, I will ſet down two points. The Firſt ſhall contain thoſe things which are common to every kind of Fracture. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhall deliver thoſe things which are proper to every ſort of Fracture. Thoſe things which are common are two: the Firſt is the Section of the ſoft parts pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the Scull: The Second is the opening of the Scull.</p>
                     <p>As for the Firſt, it is an artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeparation of the ſoft parts above the Scull, that we may come to dreſs the Scull fractured, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the coming of ill accidents, or to remove ill Symptoms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Of this Section theſe things may be demanded. 1. Whether it ought to be done. 2. Why it is to be done. 3. In what parts it is to be made. 4. Of what form it ought to be. 5. What is to be done after Section.</p>
                     <p>As for the Firſt, three Reaſons may induce us to adminiſter it ſometimes. 1. The Authority of <hi>Hip. in lib. de vulnerib. c.</hi> and of all other rational Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. Secondly, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf: for if either Blood or Quittour deſcend to the <hi>Meninges</hi> or Brain, inevitable death will
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52816:184"/>enſue, if way be not made for the expurgation of them, by making Inciſion in the ſoft parts, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scull it ſelf. The third Reaſon is daily experience, which ſhews by the death of ſundry, who by reaſon of the omiſſion of theſe Operations end their lives, that they are to be adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes which admoniſh us, that Section is to be adminiſtred, are two, Firſt, that the <hi>Cranium</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay be diſcovered, if dangerous Symptoms do appear, that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon may ſee whether it be hurt or no. Secondly, that way may be made to remove ſuch things as offend the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain, as Blood or Quittour ſetling upon them, and preſſing them down, as alſo pieces of the Inſtruments wounding, or portions of the Scull wounding or pricking theſe parts.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Section is to be adminiſtred ſafely, receive this Propoſition: Section may be made in all parts of the Hairy Scalp, if you except the Sutures and the temporal Muſcle.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, Section is not to be made in the Sutures; becauſe thoſe filaments by which the <hi>Meninges</hi> are tied to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> are of an exquiſite ſenſe, and being torn, may be inflamed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Inflammation to the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain. See <hi>Hippoc. vulner. cap. &amp; Fallop.</hi> upon him, <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Section is not to be made in the temporal Muſcle, but chiefly a tranſverſe Inciſion is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe a reſolution of that ſide of the Head, which is wounded is cauſed, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of the other ſide. By which an ugly diſtortion of the parts of the Face is cauſed. The cauſe of this Symptom is this. Whenſoever one of the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Muſcles, appointed for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry motions of the ſame part, is tranſverſly wounded, that which is wounded, muſt ſuffer a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which is not cut a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt be wary in inciſing the temporal Muſcle tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly; becauſe it is ſtill in motion, when we Talk, Drink or Eat.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the <hi>Sutura ſquamoſa,</hi> or the Scaly Suture lieth under it; but it wants not danger to make Inciſion in the Suture, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſeeing many Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, are ſpread throughout it, it being tranſverſly cut, many grievous Symptoms muſt enſue, as a great Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage, Pain, an Inflammation, a Fever, a Convulſion becauſe of the inanition of the Veſſels appointed for the containing of the vital and animal Spirits; to wit, the Veins, Arteries and Nerves being tranverſly cut aſunder. <hi>Vide Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. de vulner. cap. c.</hi> 38. As for the form of Section, it is either ſtreight, triangular, or croſs ways.</p>
                     <p>One thing here is to be obſerved, that we make no tranverſe Inciſion a little above the Eye-lid, leſt the frontal Muſcle being tranſverſly cut aſunder, a Palſie of the Eye-lid do enſue, the Muſcle not being able to elevate or lift it up, wherefore the Inciſion in theſe places muſt be
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52816:185"/>either ſtreight or oblique, not tranſverſe. See <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. lib. de vuln. cap. c.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>Now this remains wherewith you are to be acquainted, that I ſhew unto you what is to be done after that Inciſion of the ſoft part is performed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, the <hi>pericranium</hi> is to be ſeparated from the <hi>cranium,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Nails or the Splat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: you are to begin the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Points of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>pericranium</hi> be not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it will procure great Pain, an Inflammation, yea, and a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if it be torn either with a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatory or Trepan. See <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. de vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. cap. c.</hi> 38.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the brims of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion are to be kept aſunder by Doſils and Pledgets of Lint, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either with Medicaments apt to ſtay Bleeding, if it offer to flow plentifully, or only with the white of an Egg beaten, according to <hi>Arcaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. or with both the White and the Yolk to aſſwage. Pain, according to <hi>Fallop. in Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. de vulner. cap. c.</hi> 29. if there be no fear of any remarkable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Blood. The Wound ſo dreſſed, muſt not be dealt withal, until four and twenty hours be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                     <p>Having delivered unto you thoſe Points which are conſiderable in making Inciſion, to come to Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; now I muſt ſet down thoſe things which are to be noted, when the Scull is to be opened artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with ſit Inſtruments, that you may come to remove ſuch things as may offend the <hi>Meninges</hi> and the Brain. Concerning the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration theſe things may be asked: Firſt, why it is to be opened? Secondly, when it is to be opened? Thirdly, what quantity of it is to be taken away when it is to be opened? Fourthly, with what Inſtruments it is to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt, the <hi>Cranium</hi> is to be opened in five Caſes: Firſt, that pieces of the Weapon may be taken away: Secondly, that a portion of the Scull may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, which is altogether ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or offends the <hi>Meninges,</hi> if it cleave to the reſt: Thirdly, that a part of the Scull depreſſed, which bears down the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and cauſes a ſtupidity, may be either reduced to its own place, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away: Fourthly, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coagulate Blood or Quittour may be removed, which hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the Membranes, by reaſon of a breach of ſome Veſſel. Fifthly, that way may be made to apply convenient Medicaments to the Fracture. See <hi>Fallop. in Hippoc. vuln. cap.</hi> 31. and <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the ſecond, it is good to open it before the fourth day, <hi>Fallop. ibid. c.</hi> 34. and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeus. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 4. Yea, it may with good ſucceſs be opened after the ſeventh day, both in Summer and Winter-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if grievous Symptoms urge not. If therefore any one of you be called to one who hath a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the <hi>Cranium</hi> on the fourth day, (if ill Symptoms will permit) you may defer the opening until the ſeventh day be paſt; yea, the ninth: for on the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52816:185"/>fourth day the Putrefaction of the Humors begins, as alſo the inſult of Nature againſt the Diſeaſe, and ſo it is not good to hinder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature: But if for reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſes you fear leſt delay will breed danger, you are preſently to open the Scull, even on the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal day.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the quantity which is to be taken away, either the whole fractured Bone is to be taken away, or only a part of it. The whole Bone is to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Firſt if the Fracture be in an upper part, as the Crown of the Head, where no depending vent may be made to diſcharge the Blood or Quittour from the <hi>Meninges.</hi> Secondly, in a Fiſſure, or <hi>Sedes,</hi> if it be not wide enough, the whole Bone that you ſee is to be removed, at leaſt to the ſecond Table. Thirdly, all the ſhivered Bones which cleave not together, are to be taken away. Fourthly, ſo much of the Scull is to be taken away, as covering the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> becomes black, that way may be made for the application of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>In Fractures, wherein it will be ſufficient to take away only a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fractured Scull, to make way for the diſcharging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Blood or Quittour, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of other hurtful things, let it be done in the depending part; which Rule notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be omitted in two Caſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if you perceive that the <hi>Meninges</hi> are like to be inflamed: for then they ſhould more readily ſwell above the <hi>Cranium</hi> in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Brain appear, the Membranes being wounded, we muſt ſhun opening in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part; for according to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> 6. <hi>Method.</hi> ſeeing the Brain is of a ſoft and fluid ſubſtance, it would eaſily fall down to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending part. <hi>Vide Fallop. in Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. de vuln. cap.</hi> 35.</p>
                     <p>The chief Inſtruments with which we open the Scull, are theſe: Raſpatories, Levatories, Gemlets called <hi>Terebellae,</hi> the Trepan, and the Head-ſaw. Of the ſundry ſorts of Raſpatories, you may ſee choice in <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>When you will uſe Raſpatories, you muſt obſerve ſome things before the Application, ſome things in the Application, and ſome things after the Application of them. Before you uſe them, Firſt, you muſt place the Patient in a good poſture. Secondly, his Head being lapped in foulded Clothes, is to be ſtaid, and kept immoveable. Thirdly, the Ears are to be ſtopped with Cotton, or Wooll, that the noiſe offend not the Inſtruments of Hearing. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the brims of the Wound are to be covered with pieces of Linnen Cloth; Firſt, to keep them from the Inſtruments; Secondly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from the Air, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would cool them.</p>
                     <p>In the uſing of Raſpatories: Firſt, we muſt begin with the broadeſt, and then the leſs broad, and laſtly the narroweſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are often to be moiſtned with the Oyl of Roſes; firſt, that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52816:186"/>they may ſerape the more lightly, ſecondly, that they heat not the <hi>Cranium:</hi> If Blood trouble the Work, uſe Vinegar and Water. After you have uſed the Raſpato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, uſe theſe ſame Topicks which are uſed after the Application of the <hi>Trepan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Raſpatories are to be uſed in Fiſſures or Chinks, and in a <hi>Sedes,</hi> when the print of the Weapon is narrow. The ſecond Inſtrument is the Gemlet, or <hi>Terebellum:</hi> Coopers uſe the like Inſtrument to raiſe up the Staves of Veſſels, the point of it muſt be ſcrued. This hath a two-fold uſe; Firſt, it ſerves to take out the Bone cut by the Trepan, whereas it is not ſafe to cut the whole Bone through, as in the Bones of the Forehead. Secondly, it ſerves for reducing a depreſſed part of the Scull into its own place, by firſt making a ſmall hole in the <hi>Cranium</hi> with the Pin of the Trepan, and then ſcruing it in.</p>
                     <p>As concerning Levatories, you may ſee divers fornis in <hi>Parcy, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. When you uſe them, have a care that you lift up equally every part of the Bone; for if any part be depreſſed, it may hurt the <hi>Meninges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Head-ſaw, Firſt, it may be uſed when there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or a Fracture on one ſide of the Bone; for one ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſtreight line divided by it, both there will be way made to the taking away of the Bone, and the diſcharging of Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, or Blood, with ſmall loſs of ſubſtance of the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will ſerve to cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſtance of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> left after Application of the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan in divers parts.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Inſtrument: It remains now then, that I ſpeak of the Trepan: Concerning it, theſe things may be demanded: Firſt, to what end it is to be applied? Secondly, in what places it is to be applied? Thirdly, what is to be obſerved in the Application of it? Fourthly, what is to be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Application of it?</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt, the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Trepan hath a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe: Firſt, it ſerves for the raiſing up of a Bone depreſſing the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ſerves for removing of all things which hurt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and the Brain, whether they be Quittour, Blood, Splints of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> or pieces of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Thirdly, it makes way for the Application of ſit Topicks. As for the places, it muſt not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Firſt, upon the Fracture; for this will increaſe the evil, chiefly if the fractured portions be ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, it is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon a Suture, becauſe the Nervous Fibres, and the Veins and Arteries, by which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is annexed to the <hi>Perieranium,</hi> and gives it nouriſhment, ſhould be torn: from whence would ariſe Pain, Inflammation, and flux of Blood; which might be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Membranes, and Brain it ſelf. Thirdly, neither is it to be applied to the places a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above the Eye-brows; for the Wound ever afterward would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unskinned. Fourthly, it is not to be applied to the Temples, Firſt, by reaſon of the temporal Muſcle. Secondly, by reaſon of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:52816:186"/>the <hi>Sutura ſquamoſa.</hi> Fifthly, it is not to be applied to the lower parts of the Scull, if the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges</hi> be wounded, leſt the Brain fall out through the hole. Sixthly, it is not to be applied to the <hi>Sinciput</hi> of Children, which are not above ſeven years old, ſeeing it is dangerous even in theſe who are of ripe Age, unleſs great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity urge.</p>
                     <p>In the Application of the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, theſe things are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Firſt, that you take out the Pan, when you are come to the ſecond Table. Secondly, it is be moiſtned with Oyl, that it may cut the better. Thirdly, the print of the Trepan is to be moiſtned now and then with cold Water, leſt the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ull be lieated by the rubbing of the Trepan. Fourthly, ſeeing it is impoſſible to cut all the parts equally, the Scull being of a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Figure, you are to remove the Blood, that you may perceive which part is moſt deeply cut, that you lean more to the other. Fifthly, when the part cut by the Trepan begins to ſhake, it is the ſifeſt way to lift it up with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory. Sixthly, if any ragged pleces appear, which may hurt the <hi>Meninges,</hi> you are to take them away by <hi>Scalper Lenticulatus,</hi> and the Mallet of Lead, after that the Trepan is applied above the <hi>Durd Meter,</hi> apply a piece of Tafety or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HItherto I have diſpatched thoſe points which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are common to all ſorts of Fractures, which do happen to thoſe who are of ripe Age: now it remains that I ſhew unto you how all ſorts of Fractures in ſuch perſons are to be cured.</p>
                     <p>Now a Fracture in theſe perſons is two-fold: for it is either in the ſame part which hath ſuffered So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Unity, or in another part. If it be in the ſame part, it is either Simple, Compound, or Complicate.</p>
                     <p>A ſimple Fracture is, when one only kind of Fructure hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. Of theſe there are three ſorts; <hi>Rima,</hi> a Chink or a Cleft, <hi>Contuſio,</hi> a Contuſion of the Scull; and <hi>Sedes,</hi> a Sitter, when the print of the wounding Inſtrument is left in the Scull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rima,</hi> or <hi>Fiſſura,</hi> a Chink or a Cleft, is two-fold; for it is either <hi>Conſpicua,</hi> eaſily to be diſcerned by the ſight, or <hi>Inconſpicua,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardly to be diſcerned by the ſight, or not at all; which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Capillaris,</hi> a hair-like Chink. Now a conſpicuous Chink paſſeth through either one or both the Tables of the Scull. If it paſs not deeper than to the ſpongy part between the two Tables, the Chink it ſelf is ſo far to be dilated. If the Cleft paſs through both the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then the Chink is either to be dilated through both the Tables of the Scull, even to the <hi>Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or through the firſt Table at the leaſt, making way through the ſecond Table alſo, leaving a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent apertion for the diſcharging of clotted Blood, or Quittour, for the depending part of the Head, through the ſecond Table. Now the depending part is not to be taken from the ſituation of the parts of the Body, but from the poſition or poſture of them.</p>
                     <p>You muſt deal after this ſame manner with <hi>Rima inconſpicua,</hi> or <hi>Capillaris,</hi> or an obſcure Chink. But it is not an eaſie matter to find it out. If therefore you cannot diſcern it either with the Eyes, or the help of a magnifying Glaſs,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52816:187"/>cuſe the Patient to hold in his breath, and to ſtretch his Breaſt. If this be done, either a thin Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or a bloody <hi>Sanies</hi> do iſſue out, it is an excellent Sign: if this do not appear, then apply to the part moſt ſuſpicious, Ink, made thin with a little Vinegar, to make it pierce. The next dreſſing, dry the Scull with a wet Rag or Sponge, and if you ſee any print of the Ink to remain in the Scull, follow the beſineſs untill you come to the uttermoſt of the impreſſion of the Irk, although you muſt diſcover the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> Now Chinks muſt not be dilated by the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, but by Raſpatories: for we ought not to take away more of the Scull than neceſſity urges. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and <hi>Fallop. con. in lib. Hippoc. de vulnerib. cap. c.</hi> 3. When the <hi>Rima</hi> is dilated, dreſs the Wound, as you do after the Application of the Trepan; whereof I ſpake ſufficiently in the former Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sedes,</hi> or a Sitter, is a Fracture cauſed by a ſharp Inſtrument, which leaves the print of it in the Scull: if it paſs through both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and no Splints of the Bone prick the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and ſufficient way be made by the Weapon for the diſcharging of the Quittour, no further Apertion is to be made; but the Wound is to be dreſſed, as I preſcribed, after the Application of the Trepan. But if either Splints of the Bones do offend the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or the paſſage be too narrow for the diſcharging of the Quittour, a further Apertion of the Scull is to be made by ſuch Inſtruments as ſhall ſeem moſt fit for this Operation. If the <hi>Sedes</hi> paſs not further than the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the <hi>Cranium</hi> is to be ſmoothed with Raſpatories, leſt the Quittour ſetling in the <hi>Sedes</hi> cauſe a deeper carioſity. Then the Wound is to be dreſſed with <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment relented in a Spoon: It falls out many times, if the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wounded party be good, that the <hi>Cranium</hi> doth caſt no Scale.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of a ſimple Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture called <hi>Contuſio,</hi> a Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scull, reſteth to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
                     <p>A Contuſion <hi>is a Solution of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity in the</hi> Cranium, <hi>when as by the violence of an external In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, the ſmall portions of it are brought nearer together than Nature hath placed them, yet have returned to their own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after that this compreſſion is cauſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of Fracture is eſpied in the beginning, or in progreſs of time. In the beginning it is found out by the alteration of the colour of the Scull: The colour of a lively Bone is of a whitiſh colour, mingled with a lively ruddineſs; but if it be mortified, it will be whitiſh without any redneſs: if it be <hi>carious</hi> or rotten, it will be of a livid or blackiſh colour. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a kind of Fracture hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the pleaſant ruddineſs of the Scull will be gone, and white pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will appear in it, ſuch as are ſeen in the Nails of ſome Perſons Fingers. In proceſs of time, if it be left untouched, it will become of a livid or blackiſh colour, being <hi>carious:</hi> In this kind of Fracture you are to take ſo much of the <hi>Cranium</hi> as is mortified by the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52816:188"/>Contuſion with Raſpatories, and then to heal the Wound by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. So much then of the three ſorts of ſimple Fractures.</p>
                     <p>A compound Fracture is when ſome further inconvenience is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Solution of Unity in the Scull, as the loſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or removing of ſome part of it from its own place.</p>
                     <p>Of this there are three ſorts, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſio,</hi> a depreſſion, <hi>Concameratio,</hi> a vaulting, and <hi>Exciſio,</hi> or an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute diviſion of ſome part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>A Depreſſion is, when as the Scull is beaten down; in this kind of Fractures, ſhivers of the Scull are quite ſeparate from the hole ſometimes: Again, ſometimes they cleave to the hole in one part, and are ſeparate from the other. Thoſe which are altogether ſeparate, you ſhall remove with Levatories: If the fractured part cleave to the hole in one ſide, and if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not elevate it with a Levatory; then you are to apply the Trepan as near to the fractured part as you can, that as little as may be of the <hi>Cranium</hi> be taken away. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either reduce the depreſſed part to its own place, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remove it, as you ſhall think moſt expedient. In performing theſe actions, you are to uſe great caution, that the <hi>Meninges</hi> be not hurt by the ſharp Splints of the Bones fractured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Contameratio</hi> or vaulting is, when as the Scull by a ſharp point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Weapon with force being pierced, and with might being pulled out is pulled upwards, leaving an empty ſpace or vacuity beneath. If this kind of Fracture go no further than through the firſt Table, you are to ſmooth the Scull, and to heal the Wound according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſet down before. But if it paſs through the ſecond Table, you muſt open the Scull in the moſt depending part with the Trepan, to make way for the diſcharging of the Quittour: for <hi>Sanies</hi> muſt of neceſſity be lodged in the lower vacuity, or void ſpace, if the Weapon it ſelf hath not made ſufficient way: if any rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs prick the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> you are to remove the whole Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, compaſſing it with a large Head of a Trepan, and then to cure the Wound as hath been taught.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exciſio</hi> is, when the part of the Scull wounded is altogether ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the hole; if the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cut away ſtick to the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa,</hi> and the Wound go no deeper than the firſt Table, it is to be ſeparated from the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa,</hi> and the <hi>Crantum</hi> is to be ſmoothed with a Raſpatory: But if both the Tables of the Scull cleave to the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa,</hi> they are not to be taken away, but to be reduced to their own place, the Wound having firſt been cleanſed with Wine or Spirit of Wine warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa</hi> is to be faſtened to the reſt, with ſo many ſtitches of four twiſts of Silk or Thread drawn through with a rolling Needle. See an Example of this in <hi>Parl. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>A complicate Fracture is, when either ſundry Fractures of one fort do concur, or more of divers kinds. Many Fractures of the ſame ſort may happen, as ſundry Chinks. So many Chinks as are perceived
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52816:188"/>by the Eyes are to be dilated with Raſpatories. In like manner ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Fractures of divers kinds may meet, as a Chink with a depreſſion. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſuch complicate Fractures you are to proceed no other ways, than have been ſhewed in ſolitary Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for a Chink is ever to be dilated if it be conſpicuous, and the part of the Scull depreſſed muſt either be wholly taken away, I the Aſperities of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prick the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or if they do not, it is to be reduced to its own place, if it be not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparate from the ſound parts of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> According to theſe Canons curative you may proceed hall Fractures of the Scull in what part ſoever they happen, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Sutures, and that part of the Scull which lies under the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle.</p>
                     <p>A Suture may ſuffer a Solution of Unity three manner of ways: by Separation, Depreſſion, and Colliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of a Depreſſion I have ſpoken ſufficiently already.</p>
                     <p>A Diſſolution of a Suture is, when as thoſe parts of the <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> which are united by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, gape, being ſeparate by ſome external violence; if this ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be large, the Nervous Fibres, which make the Ligament by which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is tied to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> muſt be torn, tho this appear not to the ſight: from whence often ariſeth Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and danger of death.</p>
                     <p>A Colliſion is a Contuſion of the brims of the Suture, and of the Ligament which paſſeth through it, cauſed of a violent compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the brims of the Suture. In theſe Caſes if fearful Accidents, as a Fever, Vomiting, or a Convulſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do perſwade you that the Scull muſt be opened, then you are to apply the Trepan on either or both ſides of the Suture: for if you ſhould ſet it upon the Suture, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Symptoms firſt would appear, and at laſt death enſue.</p>
                     <p>If a Fracture under the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle be accompanied with a Wound, this Wound is either a Puncture, or an Inciſion, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or according to the length: if it be a puncture, or tranſverſe, it muſt prove dangerous, as hath been ſhewed. If the wound be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted long ways, it is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Doſils or Sponges: If the Fracture be a Chink, it is to be dilated by Raſpatories. But if it be a great Fracture, wherein the Aſperities do prick the <hi>Meninges,</hi> or the depreſſion of the Scull bears down them by its weight, then a triangular Inciſion is to be made a little above the Fractures, ſhunning the temporal Muſcle, and the Trepan to be applied; then the ſhivers which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparate from the ſound Scull, are to be taken away, and the reſt which are not ſeparate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their own poſiture.</p>
                     <p>After this, as often as you dreſs the wounded perſon, you are to cauſe him to bend down his Head, to ſtop his Mouth, and Noſe, and to labour to breath ſtrongly, that the <hi>Sanies</hi> may be expelled out of the Wound. When this is done, you muſt make Injection of a mundifying Decoction with a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe to waſh out all impurities, which otherwiſe would lodge there. See a memorable Example of this in <hi>Parey, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. He
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52816:189"/>adviſes to keep a leaden Pipe in the Wound, but ſeeing this by reaſon of the hardneſs muſt cauſe pain, and is not fit for the dilation of the Section, a Sponge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed is far better: for firſt it is ſoft. Secondly, it ſucks into it ſelf the impurities: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it dilates powerfully the Wound, and keeps it open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſhivers of the <hi>Cranitan</hi> caſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the laſt Chapter I diſcourſed of Fractures, which may fall out in the parts wounded: now I am to ſhew, how Fractures in other parts than thoſe which are wounded are to be handled, when they fall out.</p>
                     <p>Now Fractures, which fall out in the <hi>Cranium</hi> in another part than that which is ſubjacent to the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa</hi> wounded, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Solution of Unity of ſoft parts of the Scull wounded, or in a part ſomewhat diſtant or remote.</p>
                     <p>If a Fracture fall out to be not in the part wounded, you ſhall find it out by theſe ſeven Signs. Firſt, the Wound of the <hi>Cutis Muſculoſa,</hi> which covereth the Fracture, will not admit Cure in that part which is near the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, whereas in the other parts it will admit Cicatrization. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, out of the part near to the Wound, you ſhall perceive a thin and ichorous Matter to flow. Thirdly, more copious Matter will flow out of the Wound, than the bigneſs of the Wound can ſeem to afford. Fourthly, the Fleſh which grows near to that part is ſpongy and looſe, not firm. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, now and then the party wounded will be feveriſh. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you thruſt your Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Cranium</hi> and the <hi>Cutis,</hi> you ſhall find the <hi>Cutis</hi> ſeparate from the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Seventhly, ſome tumor and ſoftneſs will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the cutaneous part, which is placed above the Fracture.</p>
                     <p>A Fracture in a remote part, or much diſtant from the wounded part, is called <hi>Reſonitus,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-fiſſura,</hi> a counter-cleft: This falls out, when the <hi>Cranium</hi> is ſtricken upon one part, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured in another: This happens
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52816:189"/>other in the ſelf-ſame Bone, or in fivers Bones: If in the ſelf-ſame Bone, it may fall out two manner of ways; to wit, either laterally, a when the right ſide of <hi>Os Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> is beaten, and the leſt ſide cleft or contrariwiſe; or perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly from the upper to the lower part, as when not the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Table which received the blow, but the lower is fractured. If a countercleſt happen to be in civers Bones, this may fall out two manner of ways: Firſt, if the right ſide be beaten, and the leſt fractured, as if the right Parietal receive the blow, and the left be deft; or contrarywiſe. Secondly, this may happen, if the forepart be ſtricken, and the hinder part cleft, as if the <hi>Os Frontis</hi> be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the <hi>Os Occipitis</hi> be cleft, and contrariwiſe. This kind of Fracture which happens in the <hi>Cranium</hi> in a part oppoſite to the Solution of Unity, doth chance to to thoſe, who either have no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at all, or ſuch as are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kure and very cloſe; for in ſuch perſons the Air may be carried more compact, and with greater nolence from the part contuſed, or wounded, to the oppoſite part: for when the Air which is within the Scull is ſtrongly moved by a blow, and on every ſide is driven by the force of the blow, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely carried through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part: when it meets with the Scull, which by reaſon of its firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot yield, cauſeth a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the Scull; even as two men in a violent race meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are by this violent meeting beaten back. This is often ſeen in a Glaſs, which being knocked in one ſide is cleft in the oppoſite part.</p>

Although it be a hard Matter to find out this kind of Fracture, yet you ſhall go about to find it out by theſe means. Firſt, if ſigns of a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture do appear; as a Fever, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of Choler, and ſuch like, and no Chink appear in the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part, then you are to take a view of the oppoſite part. If a Tumor or Softneſs do appear in any part of it; then you may be aſſured that the Fracture is in the Scull, ſubjacent to that part. Secondly, if no Tumor or Softneſs appear in the oppoſite part, ſhave the Head

If after you have taken it away, the <hi>Cutis muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſa</hi> appear in any place more moiſt, ſoft, and ſwelled than the reſt of it is, it is likely that there the Fracture is. Thirdly, if the grieved perſon do often touch with his hand the part oppoſite to that, wherein the ſolution of unity is, not thinking upon any hurt done to it, you may ſuſpect that the Fracture is where he toucheth. If the Second Table be fractured, the firſt remaining whole, then you muſt apply the trepan, partly that you may come to take away ſplints, which do prick the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> partly to make way for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of coagulate Blood, and the <hi>Sanies.</hi> If any Patient having ſuch a Fracture do die, the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon is not much to be blamed: for a Chirurgeon may be excuſed, if the Patient die, in Four caſes. Firſt, if the <hi>Cranium</hi> by a violent Contuſion be depreſſed, and the Scull preſently return to its own place. Secondly, if the chink be only capillar, and hard to be ſeen. Thirdly, when the Second Table of the Scull is broken, the Firſt remaining whole. Fourthly, when a Fracture happens in the part op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that which is wounded. In theſe caſes the Chirurgeon may be excuſed, ſeeing the moſt skilful Artiſt may be deceived in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. If you find out a <hi>Contra-fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura,</hi> if it be but a meer <hi>Rima</hi> or chink, after you have made inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the ſoft parts lying above the <hi>Cranium,</hi> dilate the chink with the Raſpatories, that way may be made for the diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the coagulate Blood and <hi>Sanies:</hi> for theſe will be gathered, out of all doubt, in all chinks.</p>
                     <p>I have ſhewed how Fractures in a Wound happening in perſons of ripe age are to be cured: now I am to ſhew you how Fractures in the Scull are to be cured, when as the ſoft parts above the <hi>Cranium</hi> are not wounded; yet the <hi>Cranium</hi> offended. If therefore by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion the Scull be fractured, the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa</hi> not being divided, you are to ask of the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether he hath vomited cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whether he loſt his ſight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not ſpeak, whether Blood did iſſue out of his Noſtrils, and Ears, whether he ſeemed to be in a trance, whether he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a giddineſs after the blow theſe Symptoms do ſhew that there is a Fracture. And although no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents do diſcover themſelves, yet you muſt not be ſecure, but ask whether the Patient in former times hath not had the Head-ach, for then there is leſs danger, or whether he was ſtruck with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy weapon, by the hand of a ſtrong man enraged, or whether he felt a noiſe in the Brain when he was ſtrucken? If theſe ſigns appear, you muſt ſuſpend your Prognoſticks towards the beſt event. In this caſe ſo you are to go on. If no fearful ſymptomes after the blow received do continue; then ſhave that part of the Head where the blow was received: Then apply a Medicament which aſſwages pain; dries, and is aſtringent: Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

Fourthly, Oil of ſweet Almonds is to be drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Ears, that the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour which is gathered there may be diſcharged. In like manner the paſſages of the Noſe are to be moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this ſame Oil. About the fourth day you are to uſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſms made of the decoction of Barley, red Roſe-leaves, Cowſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, Betony-flowers, Eye-bright Stoechas, and ſome Rue: With the decoction you are to mingle <hi>Mel roſatum</hi> and <hi>Oxymel ſimplex.</hi> About the ſeventh day you are to uſe diſcutient Medicaments, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achylon ireatum,</hi> or <hi>Emplaſtrum de Betonica,</hi> made ſoft in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with Oil of Roſes, and in the Winter with Oil of Dill. If having uſed theſe means, fearful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes do appear after the 7th day you muſt not deferre the inciſion of the <hi>Cutis muſculoſa,</hi> and the opening of the Scull: for then it is not to be doubted but that Blood and Quittour are fallen upon the <hi>Dura mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although the ſoft parts above the Scull be not divided, yet in three caſes you muſt make inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and open the Scull. Firſt, if clotted Blood or Quittour be lodged between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> which you ſhall perceive, if Blood did iſſue out of the Ears or Noſtrils, after the blow was received, if he be ſleepy, ſtupid, or have a heavineſs of the Head. Secondly, theſe things are to be done when ſplints of the Scull do prick the <hi>Menin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which the pain in the part doth diſcover. Thirdly, when a depreſſion of the Scull remaining, bears down the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a ſtupidity, and a pricking pain, when the party blows his Noſe.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of Wounds of the</hi> Meninges and the Brain.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving delivered unto you in the laſt Chapters the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing thoſe Wounds which may befall the external parts containing of the Head; now I intend to ſhew you, how Wounds in the internal containing parts, and the contained parts are to be cured.</p>
                     <p>The internal parts containing are two; the two <hi>Meninges,</hi> or Membranes, which compaſs and environ the Brain called by the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians <hi>Dura &amp; piamater.</hi> In wounds of the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a vehement pain. Five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences may happen to the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> to wit, a Wound, Pain, Inflammation, Apoſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Diſcolouration.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive that there is an immoderate flux of Blood, the Membrane being wounded: then immediately you muſt make way to come to the Membrane, if the wounding inſtrument hath not made way enough; and <hi>Galen</hi>'s powder ſet down 6. <hi>Meth. Medend.</hi> made of Aloe, Frankincenſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, the white of an Egg, and the Down of a Hare is to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>If in a puncture of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> or after unskilful dreſſing drowſineſs and ſleepineſs ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wounded party, death ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will enſue. See <hi>Dodon. ebſerv. medic. cap.</hi> 3. Now ſeeing great pain follows the <hi>Dura mater</hi> being wounded, you muſt with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition go about to aſſwage it.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe firſt Narcotical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments have no place: for ſo both the Membrane it ſelf, and the whole Body would become ſtupefied; Secondly, unctuous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments which mollifie are not to be uſed; becauſe theſe will cauſe the Membranes to become dull, to ſwell, and laſt of all to putiefie. Wherefore Oil of Roſes warm is to be poured upon the Membrane, until the pain be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, and Quittour appear in the Wound. Then <hi>Mel reſation,</hi> or <hi>Syrupus è Roſ. Rub. Siccat.</hi> are to be mingled with Oil of Roſes, in equal quantity, until the Wound be perfectly digeſted. Laſt of all, the <hi>Dura mater</hi> is to be mundifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dried with fit Medicaments. Such are <hi>Mel roſatum, Syrupus è Roſ. Rub. Sice. Syrupus Myrtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> or <hi>Sanativus</hi> alone, having no Oil mingled with them. And although the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> by reaſon of its ſoftneſs, may be united and aggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated; yet the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard, nervous and thin, will not admit agglutination: for in agglutination the brims of the wounded part muſt be brought
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52816:191"/>and kept together, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by rolling and ſtitchings, which in this caſe cannot be uſed. Wherefore it muſt be cured by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, or procuring of fleſh to unite the parts diſ-joyned.</p>
                     <p>An Inflammation is a red Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> with a diſtention of the veſſels of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me, ſo great ſometimes, that it fills the hole of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and grows above it. This accident is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, Firſt of all, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy is to be adminiſtred, and a ſlender Diet appointed: then the part is to be fomented with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Marſh-mallows, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and Fenugreek, adding groundſell, and Violet-leaves, as alſo other Herbs which are to be applied to a Phlegmon, if occaſion ſhall require. This being done, the Oil of Roſes, Myrtils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is to be applied. If you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not by the application of theſe means, but you perceive that the Tumor rather increaſes than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes, then you are to dilate the Scull, by taking away more of it.</p>
                     <p>If Quittour be contained within the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> which you ſhall perceive by the extraordinary whiteneſs of ſome part of it, as in puſtles of the Skin, then you are warily to open it, that you in no ways touch the Brain. Then you are to apply drying and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive Medicaments, as <hi>Mel. ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, &amp; Syrupus è Roſis ſiccis. Vide Fallop. Comment. in lib.

                     <p>Diſcolouring or blackneſs may proceed from five cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> From the violence of the Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; From coagulate Blood; From the coldneſs of the Air; By the application of unproper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments; Laſt of all, from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Pia mater</hi> is very thin, and cleaves ſo faſt to the Brain, that it cannot be wounded, unleſs the Brain alſo be offended. Wherefore ſuch Wounds for the moſt part are deadly; for the Brain being laid open unto the Air, eaſily is corrupted, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cold, which extinguiſhes the weak heat of the Brain, and by reaſon of the moiſture which both falls upon the Brain, and is gathered in the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf, by reaſon of its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, if any memorable flux of Blood happen by reaſon of the multitude of Veins which are in the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> it is to be ſtaied with <hi>Galen</hi>'s Medicaments ſet down by him. 5. <hi>Method. cap.</hi> 4. whereof I have ſpoken heretofore. Then the part is to be cured with Medicaments warming and drying, which I have ſot down in the cure of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> wounded.</p>
                     <p>Now Wounds which happen in the parts contained in the Head, are to be handled: Theſe are two, <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum.</hi> To the Brain theſe griefs may happen; a Wound, Apoſtemation, Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sideration, a Concuſſion, a <hi>Fangus,</hi> and a Tumor by reaſon of Flatuoſity.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning Wounds of the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> or Brain, theſe five points may be demanded: Firſt, which are the ſigns of the Brain wounded? Secondly, what Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms do enſue? Thirdly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wounds of the Brain be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or no? Fourthly, how they are to be dreſſed? Fifthly, what Symptomes uſually remain after that a Wound of the Brain is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Of theſe I will ſpeak in order.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Firſt, the ſigns of the Brain wounded, are theſe which follow: Firſt, a Fever, and vomiting of Choler. <hi>Hippoc. Aphor. lib.</hi> 6.50. ſaith, if any have the Brain wounded, they muſt have a Fever, and vomiting of Choler. The ſame he repeats, <hi>Coac. praenot.</hi> 500. <hi>&amp;</hi> 507.

They who have ſuffered a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Concuſſion of the Brain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52816:192"/>become dumb. Thirdly, a fall and ſlumbering. <hi>Coac. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> 499. Fourthly, Senſleineſs, dimneſs of the Sight, Giddineſs. 2. <hi>Prorrhet. &amp; lib. de vulner. cap. Fernel. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Pathol. c.</hi> 8. hath theſe words: If the ſubſtance of the Brain be hurt, the Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes weak, and all Symptomes increaſe, and oftentimes a portion of the Brain comes out, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of life. Fifthly, you ſhall pronounce the Brain to be wounded, if the <hi>Meninges</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided, a ſubſtance like to fat come out; which not withſtanding doth neither ſwim above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither doth melt with the Fire, as fat doth. See <hi>Parey lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Sixthly, if the Bram be hurt, the Quittour will be thick, round, and like a Marrowy ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Symptomes which enſue, the Brain being wounded, theſe are they; Foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mouth, Darkneſs of the Sight, Giddineſs, a Convulſion, a Fever, Vomiting of Choler, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, Loſs of Reaſon, Deaſneſs, Dumneſs, a Palſie, a Lethargy, and laſt of all, an Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>As for the third demand, all wounds of the Brain are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at the leaſt, and that for theſe reaſons. The Firſt is the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the part, and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſe of the Functions of it. The Second is Motion of the Brain; but a wounded part requireth Reſt, if it be to be cured. <hi>Hip. l. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerib. circa principium.</hi> The Third is the Humidity of the Brain; but the cure of Ulcers and Wounds is performed by Exſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, according to <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Meth. Med. c.</hi> 5. The Fourth is the Coldneſs of the Brain, which engendreth many Excrements, and the more when a wound happens which weakneth the part. The Fifth is the Conſent of the Nerves which ſpring from thence. The Sixth, becauſe Remedies paſs not readily to the Brain wounded. Three cauſes may be alledged, why ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eſcape ſometimes, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great wounds in the Brain. The Firſt is, the wholſome and ſtrong Conſtitution of the Body. The Second is, the artificial dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Wound. For as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry recover of great Wounds, if they be dreſſed according to Art; ſo many die of ſmall Wounds, if they be negligently or ignorantly dreſſed. Thirdly, ſuch ſtrange events are to be aſcribed to the providence and mercy of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who of his infinite Goodneſs by his ſecret Judgment prolongeth the lives of ſome, as he ſhortneth the days of others.</p>
                     <p>Although all wounds of the Brain be dangerous, for the reaſons which I have alledged, yet great and dangerous Wounds have been cured. That this aſſertion is true, I will prove by the Teſtimonies and Experiments of famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both Ancient and Modern. Amongſt the Ancients, <hi>Galen</hi> ſhall be the Ring-leader: He then writing upon the 18th. Aphoriſm of the 6th Book of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> affirms that he ſaw one healed who had a remarkable wound in the Brain, in <hi>Smyrna</hi> of <hi>Ionia,</hi> while his Maſter <hi>Pelops</hi> was alive; he affirms this indeed to be very rare, <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>de uſu part.</hi> He makes mention in like manner, of a young Man, who recovered when he had
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52816:193"/>received a wound in one of the fore Ventricles of the Brain. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Aeginaet lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 88. affirms, that ſundry have eſcaped death, and have recovered their health, when they have been wounded in ſome principal part, above all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Chriſtophorus à Vega, Comment. in Aph.</hi> 15. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Hippocratis,</hi> hath theſe words;
<q>Wounds of the Brain, if they reach to the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they are not cured; but we have ſeen many others cured, which paſſed to the ſubſtance of the Brain, and out of which ſome portion of the Brain came out.</q> 
                        <hi>Herat. Augenius l.</hi> 9. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. writes thus;
<q>We ſaw once the whole ſubſtance of the Brain wounded, and the Ventricles cut aſunder, and that a portion of the Brain came out of the wound as ſoon as it was made, and that notwithſtanding the party was cured.</q> The cauſe of this event was the ſtrength of the Body <hi>Gem. ma l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Coſmog.</hi> ſaith, It greatly concerns Phyſicians to note, that even weak perſons ſometimes eſcape of grievous diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſigns threaten imminent danger. So lately, an ordinary perſon was by our help healed, when as a ſhiver of the Scull paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and ſome of the ſubſtance of the Brain came out. <hi>Joan. Andreas à cruce, l.</hi> 1. <hi>Chirurg. c.</hi> 14. a Venetian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that he cured ſundry whoſe Brains were wounded, and names ſundry witneſſes. <hi>Fallop. c.</hi> 45. <hi>de curatione vulnerum c.</hi> hath theſe words:
<q>A great portion of the Brain may come out, and yet life remain: Wherefore forſake not the wounded perſons, for I my ſelf have made trial of ſtrange things.</q> 
                        <hi>Carpus tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu de fracturâ cranii</hi> affirms, that he ſaw ſix perſons who recovered, when as a notable quantity of the Brain came out of the wounds, and that They only deny ſuch good events who have ſeen but a little. <hi>Braſavola in comment. ad Apher.</hi> 18. <abbr>

                     <p>The Second inconvenience which doth happen unto the Brain, is an Apoſtemation. That this may happen, theſe under-written Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do affirm; <hi>Valeriol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 8. <hi>Coiter. in Obſerv.

And although moſt Authors do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this event to be deſperate; yet <hi>Arcaeus lib. c. cap.</hi> 6. relates of one, upon whoſe Head a ſtone of a Cubit in breadth and length, and in thickneſs twelve Inches, but in weight four and twenty <abbr>lb.</abbr> fell from the Engine, as it was hoiſted up to the building of a Tower in <hi>Valverda,</hi> and bruiſed, depreſſed and ſhivered the Scull: when this Patient had lain deſperate ſeven dales, the eighth day three Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes brake out, and within the ſpace of four Months the party was perfectly cured, and afterward was married, for then he was but a young Man.</p>
                     <p>Putrefaction and Sideration are deadly Symptomes, which are not diſcerned but by opening of the Scull, and that for the moſt part when the party is dead.</p>
                     <p>The firſt accident which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the Brain is a Concuſſion or a commotion of the Brain: If it be vehement, it is alwaies dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and ſometimes deadly: If the commotion be violent, the party becomes ſpeechleſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hip. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 58. where he ſaith; <hi>They who have ſuffered a ſtrong Concuſſion of the Brain, must of neceſſity become dumb:</hi> read <hi>Galen</hi> in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon this Aphoriſm.

The Head he will have to be ſhaved: then he adviſeth to apply a Cataplaſm made of things cold and moiſt, as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm of Barley-flower, Oil of Roſes and Oxymel.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52816:194"/>part already, and bring one, if there be none: ſharp Clyſters he will have too injected to draw ſharp Vapots from the Head, and to binder the aſcent of them to the ſame, and the Vein of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and thoſe which are under the Tongue, to be opened after the ſecond day, if Blood abound. He adviſeth that ſtrong Frictions be uſed downwards, and that Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes be applied to the Shoulders. He will have the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moiſtning aſtringent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments to be uſed; of which Medicaments I have ſet down ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry forms oftentimes heretofore. If you apply diſcutient Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then ſee that you heat not the Head too much, leſt you cauſe Pain and Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>The fifth inconvenience which may happen after that there is a Solution of Unity in the Brain, is a <hi>Fungus,</hi> or the Muſhrome of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>This is a Tumor ſometimes hard, without Blood, and of ſmall ſenſe; ſometimes ſoft, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, and of an ill ſmell, beneath narrow, and above broad, a kind of a malign wart growing of the glutinous and thick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are half rotten, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the part, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Air, partly by reaſon of the coldneſs of the Scull, the Scull being opened, and the Brain wounded: even as Muſhromes grow upon Trees by a Juice which doth ſweat through the Bark, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de loc. affectis,</hi> doth make mention of this Symptom; <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> ſaith, that thoſe Excreſcences which grow in Wounds, and are called <hi>Fungi,</hi> are cauſed by the thickneſs of the Humor iſſuing from the affected parts.</p>

                     <p>The ſeventh and laſt Accident which happens when the Brain is offended, and the Scull fractured, is a flatuous Tumor. Of it <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel.

If the weak heat of the Brain go about to concoct the Matter in and about the Wound, it doth raiſe up flatuoſity, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it can breath out through the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> it doth puff it up; For, I obſerved (ſaith he) that in all thoſe in whoſe Wounds a <hi>Fungus</hi> grew, that the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> was whole, and only the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> torn; for when the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is divided, Nature out of hand goeth about to engender Fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> to defend it from the Air: wherefore, if ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humors and Flatuoſities ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Wound, they lift up the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> and this Fleſh, ſo that a Tumor like to a <hi>Fungus</hi> is cauſed: ſo he.</p>
                     <p>If you demand how it is to be cured? I anſwer, that the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Powder, ſet down by him to cure a <hi>Fungus,</hi> will ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Now to put an end to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning Wounds of the Hairy Scalp, ſeeing I have made mention of ſundry Symptoms which enſue upon them; I will ſet down the Cauſes of the chiefeſt of them, and ſo conclude.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe, the firſt is a Fall; this hath two Cauſes: The firſt is the violence of the Inſtruments which do wound: The ſecond is the privation of the faculty of moving, with the which Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of moving ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Symptom is a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo,</hi> or giddineſs: this proceeds from the Circulation, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the animal Spirits; ſo when the Clouds are driven, the Sun and Moon ſeem to move ſwiftly.</p>
                     <p>The third is dimneſs of Sight: the cauſe of this alſo is the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is Slumbring: the cauſe of this alſo is the diſſipation of the animal Spirits; but it muſt be both greater, and more durable than in dimneſs.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is Vomiting: this is cauſed by the communion of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; for the Brain being troubled, the affection is communicated by the Nerves of the ſixth Conjugation, which proceeding from the Brain, are diſperſed through the whole Body of the Stomach. So the offence being communicated to the Stomach, it is drawn inward and purſed, and turned upwards: from this Inverſion of the Stomach; firſt, thoſe things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the capacity of it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by vomiting; then thoſe Humors which are drawn from the Liver and the <hi>Cyſtis Fellis;</hi> and ſeeing Choler is moſt light, it offers it ſelf firſt, and is firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth is a Fever; this is cauſed by an Inflammation, which hath ſeiſed upon the wounded part. This being communicated to the Heart by the connexion of the Arteries, it is ſent from thence
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:52816:195"/>to the whole Body by the ſame Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh is <hi>Torpor,</hi> or Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity; this is cauſed of ill Vapors, which by reaſon of Putrefaction, or ſome other ill quality, aſſault the Brain, and diſſipate the animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The eighth is a Convulſion: this is cauſed of corrupt Vapors, which nip the beginning of the Nerves, which either a putrid or malign Matter hath ſent out: in this caſe the Neck, and the whole <hi>Spinalis Medulla,</hi> is to be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a convenient Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as this: ℞ <hi>Rut.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the cure of Wounds of the Face.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving, delivered unto you, with what diligence I could, the Cure of the Hairy Scalp. Now I am to ſhew you, how Wounds happening in the parts, which are not ſo garniſhed with Hair are to be cured. Theſe are two, to wit, the Face, and the Inſtruments of the Senſes: By the Face I mean Skin, Membranes, Muſcles, and Veſſels of the fore and lateral parts of the Head.</p>
                     <p>And although that might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the curing of Wounds of the Face, which I delivered in the documents concerning the curing of ſimple Wounds: yet becauſe the Face hath two prerogatives above all other, which are not more principal than it ſelf; it will not be amiſs to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Wounds of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>For the Face, firſt of all, is the ſeat of Comelineſs and Beauty. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is the ſureſt mark by which one is diſcerned from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Seeing then the Face doth afford unto the beholders of it ſuch contentments, you ought to have a ſpecial care that you leave no foul <hi>cicatrix.</hi> after the cure of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52816:196"/>Wounds of it, if you be called to cure them.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Face are two-fold; for in them either the ſoft parts only are wounded, or the Bones alſo. If the ſoft parts only be wounded, then they are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either according to the length, and the rectitude of the <hi>Fibrae</hi> of the Muſcles and Skin, or they are wounded tranſverſly.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound of the Face be according to the longitude, the brims of it are to be brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a convenient ligature, and glutinative Medicaments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from ſtitching with Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, for when we uſe Needles, new Solutions of Unity are procured, and ſo new Scars, and the Thread doth tranſverſly cut the Skin, and cauſeth an ill favoured <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> if it be not ſpeedily taken away; beſides pain is cauſed.</p>
                     <p>As for rolling, the Roller muſt not be broad, but narrow, and with two ends, that by ſundry cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolutions, it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bring the brims of the Wound together.</p>
                     <p>As for glutinative Medicaments, or dry ſtitching, as they are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will commend unto you two.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is an Emplaſter, the deſcription of it is this: ℞ <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen. Pic. Naval. &amp; Cerae an.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is a Powder, and it is this: ℞ <hi>Thur. Maſtich. Bol. Armen. Sang. Dracon. Colophon. cale. viv.

                     <p>One thing is be noted, that the Hem of the Cloath, upon which theſe Medicaments are ſpred, be applied towards the brims, and the raveled portion to the places diſtant from the Brims. If the ſoft parts be tranſverſly inciſed, and the Wound be long, the brime muſt gape being far diſtant aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In this caſe you muſt uſe ſtitching with Needles to bring them cloſe together.</p>
                     <p>In ſtitching you are to obſerve theſe four cautions: the firſt, that they be as thin as may be: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that the Thread be rather of Flax than Silk, but ſmooth, and waxed, that it cut not; the third is, that the Needles be as ſmall as may be, and either of Silver or of Steel diſtempered, which you may do by holding of them in the flame of a Candle: the fourth is, that when the brims of the Wound do abide together, and the Swelling and Inflammation of the brims are gone, we remove theſe ſtitches, and apply the dry ſtitches, which will fall out the third or fourth day: this you are to do to prevent ill favoured Scare. If the tranſverſe Wound be not long, convenient rolling and dry ſtitching will ſerve; for the bringing and keeping of the brims together.</p>
                     <p>When you go about to cure ſuch Wounds, apply not Powders; for when the brims are brought together, ſome ſmall diſtance muſt of neceſſity be left, which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52816:196"/>moſt be filled with Fleſh: If you then apply Powders which are loth actually, and in faculty dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the incarnation will be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the Powders drying both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Wherefore for the agglutination of ſuch Wounds, apply Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in conſiſtence are ſoft and moiſt; but in faculty drying; for by Application of ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, Nature hath time equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to agglutinate the brims, and the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> will be more fair: which is that you ought to aim at i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now if a Wound be received in the Face, wherewith both the ſoft Farts and the Bones are inciſed; we muſt in this caſe have a greater care of the ſecurity of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon, than of the beauty of the Face.

Read the Authors in the Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. I have acquainted you with the Methodical manner of dreſſing ſuch Wounds before; ſo that now in this caſe I will be ſilent.</p>
                     <p>So much I have thought good to deliver unto you, concerning the Cure of Wounds of the Face in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

                     <p>If the Wound be cauſed by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Inciſion according to the length, without loſs of ſubſtance, you may uſe the Cephalick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſuch as are aſtringent and drying, having no ſharpneſs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the unition, and procure skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for in this caſe you need not fear an ugly Scar, for the part is decked and covered with Hair.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound of the Eye-brows be tranſverſe without loſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then you muſt have a care that ſuch a Wound be exactly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate: and that the brims of the conjunction exquiſitely anſwer one another: for if theſe Cautions be neglected, the wounded party ſhall not be able to lift up the Eye-lid, unleſs he uſe the aid of his Fingers, and the Eye ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhut. In this caſe then, you muſt take deep ſtitches, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ſhall ſeem fit. The brims having been thus joyned together, procure agglutination with ſuch Medicaments as are able to reunite the parts ſevered.</p>
                     <p>If a Wound of the Eye-brow have cauſed a loſs of Subſtance: then you muſt not haſten the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation of ſuch a Wound: for if you do, the Scar will become ſo hard, that the Muſcle ſhall pull up too much the Eye-lids, and ſo the whole Eye ſhall not be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

                     <p>If the Wound cauſe a Solution of Unity in the internal Membrane of the Eye-lid, which immediately doth cover the Eye, you are to ſtitch this. For if the Thread ſhould touch the Body of the Eye, it would offend it, and procure an Inflammation. In this caſe then, a dry ſtitch is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Lips either cut aſunder only the Skin of the muſculous Parts, or the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane alſo which internally cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Mouth. If the Skin and the muſculous Parts be only cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, then ordinary ſtitching will ſerve the turn, and the application of ſuch Medicaments as unite Wounds inflicted in other parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>If the whole ſubſtance of the Lip be ſeparate, and gape; then you are to dreſs ſuch a Wound, as a Hair-lip, when as the brims are made raw.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, you are to pierce both the brims of the Wound with a Needle, or a Pin, having on each ſide a thin and ſmall piece of Lead: Through both theſe pieces of Lead, the Needle or Pin muſt paſs, then the Thread is to be twiſted about both the ends of the Needle or Pin.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, the point of the Needle or Pin is to be nipt off, that it hurt not, with a pair of ſmall ſteel Nippers well hardned. The Leads ſuffer not the Needle or Pin, to break through the brims of the Wound: you muſt take this ſtitch ſomewhat deep, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Wound, that the brims may be the more ſurely kept together. Two ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtitches more will ſerve, one above the Needle or Pin, the other below.</p>
                     <p>The Pin you may take out the fourth, fifth, or ſixth day, as you ſhall

                     <p>The Medicaments Topical which procure conſolidation in theſe Wounds, are theſe: The black na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Balſam, and not the yellow; In Winter you may uſe it alone, but in the Summer tempered with a little of the Yolk of an Egg.

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is time now to come to thoſe Wounds which offend the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Senſes; and ſeeing the Senſe of Seeing of all other is moſt admirable and noble, the Wounds of the Eye which is the Inſtrument of it, muſt firſt be handled: for it apprehends more excellent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, more in number, and of a greater variety, with a greater cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than any of the reſt of the Senſes doth, and in a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It is neceſſary for all living Creatures to eſpy and prevent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Enemies. Beſides this, the eternal felicity of reaſonable Creatures ſhall proceed from the intuitive knowledge of the Sacred Trinity.</p>
                     <p>As concerning Wounds of the Eye, two points offer themſelves to be diſcuſſed. Firſt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the cure of ſuch Wounds. Secondly, the cure it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Five things make the Wounds of the Eye of a hard Cure. 1. Is the excellency of the part it ſelf. 2. Is the exquiſite ſenſe of it. 3. The conſent which it hath with the Brain: which you may eaſily gather; if either you reſpect the Optick Nerve, or the Motory, or the Muſcles of the Bye, which have
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52816:198"/>many twigs of the Nerves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate from the firſt, ſecond, third, and eighth pair of Nerves. Fourthly, the flux of Humors, which promptly falls into the Eye after it is wounded. Fifthly, the continual motion of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>les.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of theſe Wounds too points are to be delivered. Firſt, the differences of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the artificial dreſſing of them.</p>
                     <p>As for the differences of them, Wounds of the Eye are either Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial or Deep. Superficial I from ſuch as paſs not through the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nea:</hi> But deep, ſuch as paſs ſtrough the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the cure of Wounds of the Eye, theſe two points are to be diſerved in general: Firſt, that you abſtain from all Oyls, and fat things, for they inflame the Eye, and cauſe Pain. Secondly, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hen one Eye only is wounded, you roll them up both; Firſt, that the ſound Eye may be kept from motion. Secondly, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may every way be procured; for light offends all fore Eyes: Thirdly, that the Cure may be more eaſie; for when one Eye moves, the other of a neceſſity muſt move, and ſo the wounded Eye being moved at the motion of the ſound Eye uncovered, the Cure will be hindred: for Motion cauſes Inflammation, and protracts Healing. The third is, that the Head lie ſomewhat high, not lending forwards: let the Pillow be of Turky Leather, filled with Chiff.</p>

                     <p>In this caſe it will ſuffice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe Medicaments above the Eye-lid, the Eye being ſhut, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Qulttour abound, and the Eye run much: for the Skin of the Eye lid, the Muſcle, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Membrane, are thin; ſo that the Medicament may eaſily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. Beſides, ſome will paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eye-lids. If the former Accidents happen, waſh the Eye with Rain or Plantain-Water, wherein a little Alume, or white Vitriol hath been diſſolved: then apply Boulſters made of old fine linnen Cloth, becauſe it is ſofteſt, moiſtned in ſome of the Waters, wherein ſome of <hi>Stef album ſine Opto</hi> hath been diſſolved.

                     </p>
                     <p>One thing is to be noted, that if both the Eye-lid and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva Tunica</hi> of the Eye be wounded, that you have a care that they grow not together, which happens if it be not prevented: You ſhall hinder this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if in tender perſons you keep them aſunder with ſome Leaf-Gold, but in other Bodies either with Leaf Gold, or Tin-Foil.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound be deep, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Weapon paſſed through the broad and long Chink about the ends of the Bones of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita,</hi> through which the Nerves come into the Brain, or it goes not ſo far.</p>
                     <p>If the Weapon paſs into the Brain, then the Wound is mortal, becauſe by reaſon of the diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirits, Motion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration are aboliſhed. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he is to be dreſt, and the Chirurgeon is blameleſs, becauſe he neither can ſee the Wound, nor apply any Topical Medicament to the Brain, unleſs he take out the Eye, which no wiſe man will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor can be ſuffered, in whom the Senſe of feeling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
                     <p>An Example of this I ſaw in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in a young Gentleman, whoſe Sirname was <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who in a Duel being ſo wounded in the left Eye, died about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day after he received the Wound. He continued well nine days, and the tenth day went to a Play. The eleventh day the left Noſtril began to run as if it had been a Still, ſo that every night and day it wet a Pillow: and ſo it continued untill he ended this Life.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound be not ſo deep, then either the aqueous Humor only iſſues out, or the others, as the Cryſtalline and Vitreous alſo.</p>
                     <p>If the aqueous Humor come out only, then it cometh out wholly, or in part. If all of it come out, the ſight will be loſt. If a ſmall quantity only come out, it may be repaired, and chiefly in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by reaſon of their moiſture, and ſo the ſight remains. This Wound is cured as a ſuperficial Wound.</p>
                     <p>If the other Humors, as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous and the Cryſtalline, come out, then the ſight muſt of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be loſt. In the cure of this Wound you are to uſe ſarcotical Powders, but beaten very ſmall, and paſt through a fine ſearce, ſuch as <hi>Tutia</hi> prepared, <hi>Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> quenched in white Wine, <hi>Terra ſigillata, ſanguis Draconis, Aes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, Sarcocolla, Sandaracha Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> &amp;c. When the Eye is heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you may cauſe an artificial Glaſs-eye to be ſet in place of the natural, to avoid defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>It falls out ſometimes that part of the wounding Inſtrument ſticks in the Eye. If a portion of a wounding Inſtrument doth ſtick ſo faſt, that it cannot be pulled out without the effuſion of all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Eye, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of great Inflammation, and that doth not prick the Eye-lids, then it is beſt to ſuffer it to remain, and to dreſs the Wound with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:52816:199"/>Medicaments, untill the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day be paſt, and then to uſe agglutinative means. But if the piece cauſe pain, and a continual weeping, and hurt the Eye-lids, it is to be taken out, and dreſſed as deep wounds of the Eye. See an Example in <hi>Fabric. ab aq. pendent. Chirurg. operat. part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>Next to the cure of wounds of the Eye, I will ſhew how wounds of the Ear, which is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hearing, are to be cured.</p>
                     <p>The Ear is either wholly cut off from the Temple of the Head, or but in part divided. If it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally cut off, firſt of all, it is to be skinned with ſtrong Epulotical Medicaments, as the Cephalick Powder, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de bolo, de minio,</hi> and ſuch like. Then the deformity is to be covered either by wearing a long Lock, or a Cap under the Hat having a ſide latch. If it be divided but in a part, if the ſeparation be but ſmall, a dry ſtitch only will ſerve; but if it be large, a ſmall Needle, and fine Thread muſt be uſed, that the part ſeparate may be proportional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought and kept together. Then ſtrong deſiccative Topicks are to be uſed, becauſe the part it ſelf is for the greateſt part Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous.</p>
                     <p>In your ſtitching you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things: Firſt, that the Needle only bring together the parts of the Skin, on each ſide of the Ear within and without, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding the Cartilage; for if this be done, an Inflammation and Gangrene may enſue, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, <hi>Fabric. ab. aq. pend. oper. Chirurg. part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 33. <hi>&amp; Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you muſt obſerve, that if the Wound reach to the firſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Ear, called <hi>Meatus Auditorius,</hi> the paſſage of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſtill keep a Sponge-Tent in it, partly that no ſpongy fleſh grow in it, which might ſtop it, and ſo hinder the Hearing; partly that no Quittour fall into it, which might exulcerate the parts internal, and corrupt the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> and ſo procure inevitable deafneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now I will briefly touch only the cure of Wounds with which the Noſe (the Inſtrument of ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) may be violated. Wounds then of the Noſe may only cauſe a Solution of Unity in the ſoft parts, or in the hard parts alſo.</p>
                     <p>If a Wound happen in the ſoft parts of the Noſe, a dry ſtitch will ſuffice: In theſe wounds we muſt, to the uttermoſt of our endeavour, labour to procure a fair <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> or Scar: ſeeing the Noſe is the moſt eminent part of the Face, and but a ſmall Scar will eaſily be diſcerned in it: wherefore you are to procure a fair <hi>Cicatrix</hi> with ſome Medicaments aſtringent: ſuch is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum album caphuratum,</hi> if it be faithfully diſpenſed.</p>
                     <p>If the hard parts be wounded, then this muſt fall out either in the upper part, and then the Bone muſt be violated; or in the lower part, and then the Cartilage muſt be hurt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if a Wound be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in the upper part of the Noſe, wherein the Bone is cut, then there is a Wound and a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:52816:200"/>In curing of ſuch a Wound, two Indications offer themſelves: for, firſt, the Bones muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly be ſet; then the conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wound is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                     <p>In placing handſomly the Bones, you muſt put into the Noſe a fit piece of Wood, lapped with ſoft linnen cloth, which muſt eaſily go in to bear up the Bones: then outwardly you are to ſet the Bones in their beſt poſture with your other hand. This being done, you muſt put a pipe into the Noſe of ſome light ſubſtance, as of the branches of Flder, the pith being taken out, or made of a thin plate of Silver: for the preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you may uſe a Gooſe-quill, or a Swans-quill, or a Quill made of a Reed, ſuch as Weavers uſe. Theſe Quils or Pipes muſt not be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely round, but ſomewhat ſharp above, and flat below, to preſerve the natural figuration of the Noſe.</p>
                     <p>When you uſe theſe, you muſt obſerve two things: Firſt, that they be tied to the night-cap on each ſide, that they drop not out: Secondly, that you put them not too far up, leſt they cauſe ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which much hinders the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation of ſuch Wounds.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Pipes afford a four-fold uſe: Firſt, they keep the Bones in their beſt poſition: Secondly, they give way to breathing: Thirdly, they diſcharge the excrements of the Brain: Fourthly, they make way for the ſending of the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour from the Wound. Theſe pipes muſt be lapped up in ſoft linnen Cloth, to hinder the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the conſolidating Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the Wound.</p>
                     <p>The Bones thus ſet according to Art, you muſt labour to bring the ſoft brims of the Wound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, either by a dry ſtitch, or with a ſmall needle and thread, according as occaſion ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto you.</p>
                     <p>This being done, apply a deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Medicament to the Wound, as <hi>Sangais Draconis,</hi> and <hi>Bole</hi> beat to a fine powder, and mingled with the white of an Egg beaten: let the conſiſtence be like to that of Honey.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch a wound be tranſverſe, Firſt, you muſt apply to each ſide of the Noſtrils a fine little Boulſter of ſoft, linnen Cloth, moiſtned in red aſtringent Wine, and wrong out: then you muſt ſtay theſe Boulſters with a roller; having a hole in the middle to give way to breathing, and to receive the tip of the Noſe. This Roller muſt be ſowed to the back part of the Head.</p>
                     <p>You muſt have a care of one thing, that it be no ſtraiter than is neceſſary, for the keeping of the Noſe from falling; for if it be too ſtrait, it will procure a Polt-foot-like Noſe ſteering upwards. Hard to the <hi>Septum</hi> of the Noſe apply another very narrow Roller, which bring about to the Neck, as you did the other.</p>
                     <p>If the lower part of the Noſe be deeply wounded, then the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage muſt ſuffer ſolution of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which if it come to paſs, then the Cartilage is only divided, or quite out off. If it be only divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then Unition is to be proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a pipe to be uſed, drying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments to be applied, and the like Rolling to be uſed, as I ſet
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:52816:200"/>down in the cure of a wound in the upper part of the Noſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bone is inciſed. If the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage be wholly cut off, then a new Noſe is to be framed of the skin of the Arm. Of this <hi>Talia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citius</hi> hath written at large, and I will touch this practice in my <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which I made the third part of Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>To make an end of this Chapter, I muſt ſhew you briefly how wounds of the Tongue the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Taſting are to be cured.</p>
                     <p>If a portion of the Tongue be altogether cut off, the loſs is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irreparable: for being once deprived of life, being ſeparate from the reſt of the living Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it cannot by any created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be reſtored. Our Saviour reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear cut off by <hi>St. Peter;</hi> but we know that he was both God and Man, the Lord of Life, able to give it, or to take it from any, according to his good pleaſure. If the part ſeparate cleave to the ſound part, although it be but by a fleſhy thred, ſo that it doth totter hither and thither, yet beware that you cut it not off, ſeeing the loſs of Speech, (the mean of mutual conference) will ſo enſue.</p>
                     <p>Such a Wound is hardly cured; partly, becauſe we can neither uſe dry ſtitching nor rolling; partly, becauſe ordinary Topicks, as Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame and Emplaſters cannot be Employed.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe you are to uſe ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Needle and Thread. But firſt of all, the Tongue is to be pulled out, being holden by the hand, it having been lapped with a linnen Cloth, or by hollow and rugged <hi>Forcipes</hi> armed with cloth. Then ſo many and ſo deep ſtitches are to be taken as ſhall ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to keep the parts united. Neither let us be too ſcrupulous with <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 26. who thinks that the leſs fleſh the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle pierceth, the Inflammation or pain will be the leſs; rather let us bind ſure that we may ſtill find ſure. We may eaſily conjecture how the wounded party will be diſheartened if the ſtitches ſhould break. The Wound being ſurely ſtitched; we muſt firſt cut off the thread hard by the knot, leſt the ends of the thread, being intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led between the Teeth, ſhould cauſe a renting of that which you did ſow.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt uſe aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent means, ſuch as are Plantain-water, wherein the Syrup of Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or dry red Roſes, with ſome Alum, have been diſſolved.

                     <p>HAving diſpatched Wounds which may happen to the Head, I muſt now fall to thoſe wounds which may offend the Neck. Now theſe Wounds cauſe ſolution of continuity either in the common parts of the Body, or the parts proper.

                           </gap>a carnoſa.</hi> The parts proper, are the veſſels and the other parts. The veſſels are three, the jugular Veins, the ſoporal Arteries, and the recurrent Nerves. The other parts are the <hi>Larynx</hi> or Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and the <hi>Gula,</hi> or the mouth of the Stomach, and the <hi>Spinalis medulla:</hi> Of theſe I will diſcourſe in order, as they are ſet down. Thoſe Wounds which happen to the common parts, the Skin, and the <hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> require no particular tractation; for they are cured by joyning together the parts dif-joyned, and by application of agglutinative Topicks. Seeing theſe parts are looſe and flaggy, you may ſtitch theſe parts, althô there be ſome loſs of ſubſtance.

                        </gap>e a ſpecial conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then to come to the wounds of the veſſels: If the internal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Veins, and ſoporal Arteries, be deeply and largely wounded, the wounded party can hardly eſcape. Firſt, becauſe the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party doth flux to death moſt commonly, before any Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can come to ſtay the bleeding. Secondly, becauſe no ſtrait Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be applied to theſe Wounds, becauſe it might choak or ſtrangle the wounded party. <hi>Celſ. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 26. ſaith, <hi>Periculoſa ſunt vulnera ubicunque venae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores ſune:</hi> thoſe Wounds are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous whereſoever great Veins are. <hi>Hip. prorr. l.</hi> 2. affirms thoſe wounds to be deadly, whereas the thick, that is the great and large Veins, are wounded in the Neck and Groins. Of the danger of theſe wounds, <hi>Foreſt. Obſ. Chirurg. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4. thus warneth us: The jugular Veins receiving a great Wound, hardly and very ſeldom are cured, becauſe they deprive a man of the vital ſpirit, by reaſon of the large effuſion of Blood; and becauſe theſe Wounds will not admit ſuch rolling for the ſtaying of bleeding as is neceſſary. <hi>Guliel.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52816:201"/>Fabric. Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. makes this manifeſt by an example: When a certain Empirick went about the cutting out of a <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> in the Neck of a Genevan Maid, which had incloſed the jugular Vein, and the recurrent Nerve, ſo great a flux of Blood iſſued, that the Maid died in the very ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The like chance happened to one Mr. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> who going about the like operation in a young Gentlewoman, then lying in <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-bury,</hi> had no better ſucceſs. Doctor <hi>Gwin</hi> and I were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Let theſe and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples procure warineſs when you go about to deal with Tumors in the lateral parts of the <hi>Jugulum,</hi> or Throat.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch Wounds, a Wound of the Artery is more dangerous than of the Vein. Firſt, becauſe the Blood of the Artery is more fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more ſpirituous: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the coats of the Artery are hard, and are in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know an Artery to be wounded by theſe ſigns: Firſt, the Arterial Blood guſheth out ſorcibly and leaping, when the Artery is dilated, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction the Blood is drawn back. Secondly, the Arterial Blood is thinner; but the Venal thicker. Thirdly, the Arterial Blood is of a bright red colour; but the Venal is blacker.

                     <p>As for the cure of ſuch Wounds, the firſt ſcope is to ſtay the flux of Blood, which is the ſtore-houſe of the vital ſpirit: the Second is, to agglutinate the Wound.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Wounds of the other parts of the Neck.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving delivered unto you in the former Chapter, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing Wounds which may happen to the veſſels ſeated in the lateral parts of the Neck; I am to ſhew you how Wounds, which cauſe a ſolution of unity in other parts of the ſame, are to be cured. Now thoſe members are ſeated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fore-part of the Neck, or in the back-part: In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the <hi>Trachaea arteria,</hi> or Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe is placed; but in the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the <hi>Gula,</hi> or the mouth of the Stomach, and <hi>Spina dorſi,</hi> or <hi>Spinalis medulla,</hi> the marrow or pith of the Back-bone.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> or Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe be wounded thorow: Firſt, the breath will come out at the Wound. Secondly, Blood will iſſue out at the Mouth. Thirdly, the Speech will be hindred. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Coughing will trouble the wounded party.</p>
                     <p>The Wind-pipe hath three parts: Firſt, the uppermoſt part of it, called <hi>Larynx:</hi> The Second, <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> or the ſtump: the Third, the Branches ſpread thorowout the ſubſtance of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> although they be not mortal of themſelves, yet by accident they may become ſuch: Firſt, by reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe, for it doth receive and breath out the Air. Secondly, by reaſon of the fearful Symptomes, or accidents which accompany ſuch Wounds; for this part is near to the jugular Veins and ſoporal Arteries: ſo that it can hardly be wounded, unleſs theſe parts be wounded alſo. It hath alſo ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Branches of the recurrent Nerves, and beſides ſundry Muſcles; ſo that a great flux of Blood, Pain, Inflammation, Purſing or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and at laſt ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may enſue. Thirdly, becauſe this part can hardly be cured; for Medicaments cannot eaſily be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied or kept to the part.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the <hi>Caudex, vel Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> or of the Stump or Pipe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo dangerous as thoſe of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> for the reaſons before alleged; yet they are not without danger, for it is framed of a double ſubſtance; for the rings called <hi>Anuli</hi> are cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous, but the ſubſtance which ties theſe together, is membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. Now a Cartilage cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doth not admit unition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hip. Aph. li.</hi> 6. <hi>Aph.</hi> 19.

Three cauſes may be alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this: Firſt, becauſe a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage is a part drie, without Blood, and hard. Secondly, becauſe the cold Air doth continually paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſtump. Thirdly, becauſe it is ſeldom at reſt, but ſtill in motion. You may add another reaſon, becauſe the Air doth not freely paſs and repaſs by it, chiefly if the Wound be deep and large. Of theſe Wounds thus writes <hi>Vidus Vidius de curat. Morb. Membrat. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 6. Wounds which paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Wind-pipe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cauſe ſpeedy death, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Blood which iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the jugular Veins, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the Lungs, and hindreth breathing: And <hi>Foreſt. Obſerv.

                     <p>As for the cure of ſuch Wounds: if the Wound be tranſverſe, then the wounded party muſt bend down his Head: if the Wound be ſtreight, according to the length of the pipe, then the party is to hold up his Head, that the brims of the Wound may be brough. together: then the Wound is to be ſtitched as firmly and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as you can: Pins in this caſe are beſt, as alſo in curing a Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, for all kinds of thread will eaſily rot. This being done, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Medicaments are to be uſed. <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment is good, and the natural black Balſame: Above apply <hi>Dinchylon ſimplex</hi> malaxed with Oil of Myrtils or Quinces. In your dreſſing you muſt have a care that neither Blood nor Quittour fall upon the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, leſt it procure choaking; but that they be outwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the depending part. If after dreſſing, the party breath with difficulty, and there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Suffocation, becauſe the cavity of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> or <hi>Piſtul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Wound Gargariſms are good: Take this as a pattern: ℞ <hi>Hord. mundat. Cochl.</hi> iij. <hi>Flor. Roſ. rub. Pug.</hi> 1. <hi>Sumach. Flor. Granat. an.</hi>

As for the cure of theſe Wounds; The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is by ſtitching, to bring the brims of the Wound together: yet care muſt be had, that an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be left in the depending part, to be kept open with a Tent, that the Quittour may be diſcharged, and that Meat ſtick not there, which might cauſe Inſlammation. Then ſuch Medicaments are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as I ſet down for the cure of Wounds of the Wind-pipe.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Wounds a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be had of the Diet: ſeeing then the wounded party can hardly ſwallow, his Food muſt be liquid, and it muſt nouriſh much.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Wounds of the Breaſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WOunds of the Breaſt are either not penetrating to the cavity of the Breaſt, or elſe they do penetrate. Thoſe that penetrate, are either without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence done to any part contained therein, or ſome part or parts are wounded.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know the wound to penetrate by theſe ſigns: If the Patient ſhut his Mouth and Noſe, the breath will break through with a noiſe, ſo that it will move and diſſipate the light of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſet near the wound; and the Patient will be troubled with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing. If the parts contained be wounded, you ſhall know which of them is wounded by the proper Symptoms, with which the Patient is troubled, as follows.</p>
                     <p>If the Heart be wounded, much Blood guſhes out, a trembling poſſeſſes all the members of the Body, the Pulſe will be ſmall and weak, the colour of the Face will become very pale, a cold Sweat,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52816:205"/>and frequent ſwooning will aſſault the wounded party; and when the Limbs grow cold, Death is at the Door.</p>
                     <p>If the Lungs be wounded, it will be diſcerned by theſe ſigns: the Blood which comes out of the Wound is yellowiſh and froathy, a Cough enſues, the Patient hath difficulty of breathing, and a pain in the wounded ſide, which before he had not; he lieth at greater caſe when he lieth on the wounded ſide; but being turned on the contrary ſide, theſe eaſements are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bated.</p>
                     <p>When the Midriff is wounded, theſe Accidents follow: The party is troubled with a heavineſs of that part; he is taken with a raving by reaſon of the branches of the Merves of the ſixth conjugation of the Brain, which are ſpread through the body of it, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Cough, a ſharp Pain, and Fever will trouble the party wounded; yea, the Stomach and Guts ſometimes by the vehemency of breathing, will be drawn up into the capacity of the Cheſt through the Wound, as once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Ambroſe Parey,</hi> as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</p>
                     <p>That a Veſſel is wounded, and Blood poured forth into the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Breaſt, you ſhall know by theſe Symptoms: there will be a difficulty of breathing; the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will increaſe; he will vomit Blood; after the Blood putrefying the Breath will ſtink; his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite will be loſt; he will have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to vomit; he deſireth not to ſit up, and often fainteth, noiſome Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors aſſaulting the Heart, being taiſed up from the putrefied Blood.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks of Wounds of the Breaſt, receive theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Wounds of the Breaſt which either pierce not to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or if they be penetrant, hurt neither Veſſel nor Entral, are not deadly, but may ſpeedily and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be cured, if a me thodical courſe be taken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the great Veſſels (whether they be Veins or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) be wounded, they cauſe death. See <hi>Celſus, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 16. and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. prorrhet. lib.</hi> 2. becauſe they ſpend a man by great effuſion of Blood, which can hardly be ſtaid for two Reaſons: Firſt, becauſe they lie deep in the Body, ſo that neither can they be bound, nor Medicaments convenient be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them: Secondly, becauſe the Coats of them are membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and ſo cannot be healed by the firſt intention: yet if the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be divided, the Wound is more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by reaſon of the Blood contained in it; for it is more ſpirituous than that in the Veins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by reaſon of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Blood; for ſeeing the Blood of the Arteries is more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous, and hotter, it iſſues out leaping, ſo that it can hardly be ſtaid.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe of the Coats of the Arteries; for they are harder than thoſe of the Veins, and ſometimes become Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by reaſon of the hard conſolidation of the Coats of the Arteries; for they are ſtill in the motion of dilatation and conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52816:206"/>but conſolidation doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reſt, as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Method. c.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, by reaſon of an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma,</hi> which moſt commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after that a Wound is cured, wherein an Artery hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                     <p>As for Wounds of the Lungs, they are either ſuperficiary and ſmall; or deep, wherein the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs are wounded, and the great Veſſels divided: thoſe may be cured; theſe are deadly for eight Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are in continual motion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lungs are very moiſt, and ſo ſubject to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Putrefaction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Medicament can hardly reach to the bottom of the Wound.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe the diſcharging of the Quittour (which is requiſite for Cure) is both hard and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; hard, becauſe it muſt be diſcharged by expectoration by the upper parts; dangerous, becauſe this muſt be performed by cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which the Wound is more torn.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe a fearful flux of Blood muſt enſue, the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa,</hi> and the <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, and ſo many Vital Spirits muſt ruſh out together with this ſpirituous Blood.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe great plenty of Blood muſt fall into the capacity of the Breaſt, which firſt by its heavineſs muſt preſs down the Diaphragm, and cauſe difficulty of breathing; and afterward, being turned to Quittour, acquires a malign qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo may procure a Fever, Raving, and Convulſion; yea, in proceſs of time <hi>Empyema,</hi> and laſt of all a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> and Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Acrimony of the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour corroding the tender ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs: That a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> doth enſue after an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema, Hippoc. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>aph.</hi> 15. witneſſeth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Becauſe the entring of freſh Air into the Lungs, and the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fuliginous Vapors from the Heart are hindred.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Becauſe the Heart muſt of neceſſity be affected by conſent, for the Lungs are inſtead of a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and fan to the Heart, to wit, <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> from the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> from the left.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that dangerous Wounds of the Lungs have been ſometimes cured, read <hi>Plater. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>obſerv. pag.</hi> 690. <hi>Horſtius lib.</hi> 3. <hi>obſerv.

                     <p>If the <hi>Pericardium</hi> be wounded, the Wound of it ſelf is not deadly, for it it but a miniſterial and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roble part, and hath both few and and ſmall Veſſels and Nerves, and it doth not cleave to the Heart, but leaves ſo much diſtance as gives way to the pulſation of the Heart, and is fit to contain the wateriſh Humor; yet by accident it may become deadly, if it be ſo great, that all the wateriſh Humor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the ſubſtance of the Heart be wounded, the Wound is ſo be accounted deadly. See <hi>Hippoc. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>aph.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp; Galen. in comment.

                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the Heart is the beginning of Life, and ſo it being ſpoiled, it can afford no help to the reſt of the parts. See <hi>Ariſt. lx. citato.</hi> Secondly, becauſe it is the laboratory of the Vital Spirit. Thirdly, becauſe it is the ſhop of the vital Blood.

                     <p>Now to come to the cure of Wounds of the Breaſt, thoſe which do not penetrate require no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſideration, but are ſubject to the Intentions which have been delivered for the cure of Wounds in general.</p>
                     <p>In curing of penetrating Wounds, thus you muſt proceed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you muſt lay the Patient in his naked Bed, his Feet being ſtretched out at length, and the Orifice of the Wound down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>The Patient being thus placed, let him lie ſtill untill the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon hath made ready ſuch things as are to be applied to the Wound: in the mean time let the wounded party labour to further the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Blood, without the Veſſels fallen into the cavity of the Breaſt, by coughing, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his breath.</p>
                     <p>When no more Blood iſſueth out, then put into the Wound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Flammula,</hi> dipped in the white of an Egg, ſo that the greateſt part hang without the Wound: for this neither cauſeth Pain, nor let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Air, and is ſufficient for the diſcharging of any hurtful moiſture, Whereas a Tent may be ſwallowed up by the Wound, hindreth the flowing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grieveth the Patient, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continued cauſeth a <hi>Fiſtula:</hi> whereas the <hi>Flammula</hi> may be continued untill the fortieth day, the longeſt time required for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary penetrating Wounds.</p>
                     <p>In ſtead of a <hi>Flammula</hi> you may uſe a Silver Pipe, ſuch as is uſed when a <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> is adminiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Wound and the Pipe are to be anointed, either with <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment melted in a Spoon, or with ſome artificial Balſam warmed. Above, apply <hi>Diachylon ſimplex:</hi> While you dreſs the Wound, it is convenient, chiefly in the Winter time, to hold a Pan with hot Coals above the Wound, to hinder the expiration of the natural heat, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the cold Air.</p>
                     <p>One thing I would have you to obſerve, that both Blood and Quittour which is lodged in the capacity of the Breaſt, may be diſcharged both by Coughing and by Urine. If it be diſcharged by Coughing, firſt, the Matter is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:52816:207"/>into the <hi>Pleura,</hi> then into the ſubſtance of the Lungs; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is carried to the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and from thence mounting up to the Mouth it is ſpit out. If it be evacuated by Urine, then it paſſeth firſt into the ſubſtance of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> then into <hi>Vena ſine pari,</hi> near to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> where a branch of it doth paſs by a ſtreight courſe to the Emulgents, and ſo to the Ridneys and Bladder. See an Example of this in <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius ab aq. pendent. part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 42.</p>
                     <p>One here may move a Queſtion, why it is ſo dangerous a matter if Matter fall into the capacity of the Breaſt, and ſo light if it fall into the capacity of the <hi>Abd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the Matter which falleth into the cavity of the Breaſt, is eaſily inflamed; partly becauſe it is ſtill moved by the parts of the Breaſt; partly becauſe it is lodged near to moſt hot parts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the Breaſt doth require an ample and free ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for inſpiration and expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to cool and preſerve the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is a hard matter to draw by any paſſage the matter from thence, unleſs it be in the depending part, even if you uſe a large and wide Syringe called by <hi>Galen, Pyulcus.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the cure of a</hi> Fiſtula of the Breaſt following a Wound thereof.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF after you have diligently and carefully uſed the means ſet down by me, concerning the cure of Wounds of the Breaſt in the former Chapter, for the ſpace of ten days, you ſee that the Wound tends not to Unition, you may imagine that a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> may enſue. That a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> will enſue (if it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented) you ſhall conjecture by theſe ſigns.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if during the aforeſaid time, you have uſed both inward and outward means, and yet the Wound ſends out greater ſtore of Quittour, than it did before, it is a great ſign that the Wound is growing towards a <hi>Fistula,</hi> and that the Patient is entring into a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Wound ſend forth a thin bloody Quittour, like to Water wherein Fleſh hath been waſhed, the ſame is to be feared: for this is a ſign that much coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Blood is lodged within the Breaſt, which muſt be turned to Quittour, and be diſcharged part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by expectoration, partly at the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:52816:208"/>Wound; which will require a long time, during which, the Wound may become fiſtulate, if it be not well looked unto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the Quittour which iſſues out of the Sore, ſtinks vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, as the breath alſo, a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> may be expected: for this ſhews that there is a great putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in ſome parts, which are contained within the capacity of the Breaſt, which is not eaſily overcome; firſt, becauſe no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Medicaments which chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt putrefaction, as <hi>Aloe,</hi> Myrrhe, Wormwood, the leſſer Centaury, <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> &amp;c. are to be injected, as hath been ſaid: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe we cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently apply Topicks to the parts affected: Thirdly, becauſe they cannot be kept to the wounded parts, by reaſon of the motion of the Heart, Lungs, Midriff and Ribs, in Inſpiration, and Expiration: Fourthly, becauſe the Body is like to fall into a conſumption, ſo that it is to be feared, leſt a convenient ſupply cannot be afforded by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to repair the Solution of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which you have taken in hand to cure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if a wateriſh ſubſtance, thô not bloody, do ſtill come out at the Wound, (do what you can) you are to fear leſt a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; for it is to be feared leſt ſome Spermatick Parts, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes or <hi>Fibres</hi> are wounded, which admit not Unition accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt intention, or that there is ſome ſtore of coagulate Blood in the capacity, which will require no ſhort time for ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and diſcharging. When you ſhall ſee theſe ſigns appear, then are you to ſummon your Wits, and go about the prevention of a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> This caſe hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted very difficult, yea, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in great Wounds of the Breaſt, by moſt Chirurgeons both Ancient and Modern. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus Arcaeus</hi> aroſe in the laſt Age, a Spaniſh Phyſician, who by his Wit and Practice found out a way of curing, not only Wounds tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fiſtulation, but ſuch alſo as are <hi>de facto</hi> fiſtulate, and charitably hath conſigned it in his Treatiſe of Wounds, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</p>

                     <p>As for the Diet, ſuch a one he preſcribes, if the party be ſtrong, for eight days and more, according to the toleration of the party wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is to eat nothing but Bread and Raiſins: for he affirms, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the internal Phyſick, it is of two ſorts, Purging and Pectoral.</p>

Secondly, becauſe the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour cannot be promptly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. Thirdly, becauſe much Quittour is gathered: And they are more hardly cured, if the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice lie upward, and not in the depending part: Two means he appointeth for the cure of theſe; and becauſe they are very rational, they are not to be paſſed over in ſilence.</p>

                     <p>All Authors almoſt, who have diſcourſed of Wounds of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> have made mention only of Wounds received in the fore part of it; but have made no mention of Wounds inflicted into the back, which pierce alſo into the cavity or hollowneſs of it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe are moſt dangerous by reaſon of the <hi>Spinalis Medulla,</hi> which is placed there; and the multitude of Nerves which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence. If ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent do fall out, firſt you are to dreſs the Wound in the Back, as I have ſet down in the ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Chapter.

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of Wounds of the</hi> Abdomen, or lower Belly, which penetrate, and yet without any hurt of the parts contained.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THeſe Wounds either pierce to the cavity through the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> or elſe they do not penetrate. If they pierce, then either ſome part ſtarts out of the Wound, or elſe none doth. The parts which ſtart out, are either the Caul or the Guts: if no part ſtart out, then either ſome part contained is wounded, or none at all.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall conlecture a Wound to penetrate: Firſt, if the Probe, or a Wax-candle go deep in ſtreight-ways: in ſearching you muſt firſt ſee that the Wound be not inflicted obliquely: for in this caſe you may thruſt the Probe a great way between the Muſcles, the Wound notwithſtanding not penetrating. 2. You muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearch, that the paſſage of the Wound be not ſtopped with any of the ſuper-jacent Bodies, as
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:52816:210"/>the Fat, the <hi>Membrana Carnoſa,</hi> or the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Injection be made with Wine warmed, if the Wound penetrate, the Wine will be received within the cavity; but if it pierce not, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we may conjecture by the Figure of the Weapon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it penetrate or no: for if it grow broader from a ruſh point, and the Wound be broad in the outer part, it is likely that the Wound is penetrating.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the Caul, or one of the Inteſtines ſtart out of the Wound, then no doubt is to be made of the penetration of the Weapon.</p>
                     <p>As for the preſages, receive theſe: Firſt, a Wound of the Belly, not penetrating, is void of danger, unleſs it be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily large; for in ſuch a Wound many parts muſt ſuffer Solution of Unity, the pain muſt be great, many Spirits muſt be diſſipated, and the party muſt be more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fainting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Wound received in the middle part of the Belly, is more dangerous than that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſides: Firſt, becauſe in the middle it is more tendinous, and ſo the more ſenſible and ſubject to Inflammation and Pain. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Inteſtines roll to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle part.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all penetrating Wounds are to be accounted dangerous: Firſt, becauſe they are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly large, but always deep. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the Air hurts the Guts. Thirdly, becauſe Quittour falls into the capacity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when in a Wound of the Belly, any of the remarkable parts contained are wounded, it is to be accounted a deadly Wound moſt commonly. Of ſuch Wounds <hi>Celſus</hi> thus pronounceth;
<q>He cannot eſcape who is wounded in the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Brain in the Stomach, in the <hi>Portae</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to whom the middle of the Lungs, the <hi>Jejunum,</hi> the ſmall Gut, the Kidneys or the Bladder are wounded.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the cure of ſuch Wounds, Firſt, a Wound not penetrating is cured without any difficulty, as Wounds in other fleſhy parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Wound be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, and any part contained ſtart out, four Intentions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The firſt is, that the part be ſituate in its own place. The ſecond is, that the Wound be ſtitched. The third is, apply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Medicaments. Fourthly, that a courſe be taken for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of ill Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>If the Gut ſtart out, and you be preſently called to it, then you are to thruſt it in with Hands and Fingers. But if it hath long hung out, and by reaſon of the cold Air be filled with flatuoſity, and ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that it cannot be reduced; firſt of all you are to uſe an incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Fomentation to diſcuſs the Flatuoſity, and then to try the repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it. The Fomentation muſt be made of Chamaemil, Melilot, Dill, Peny-royal, Germander, Tanſey, Lavander, Wormwood, Mints, Bay-berries, Cumminſeeds, Fennil-ſeeds and Aniſeeds, boiled in red aſtringent Wine, or Milk, if ſuch a chance fall out in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52816:211"/>If after ſufficient Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation you cannot put in the Gut, then you are to dilate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
                     <p>If the Caul come out, and by reaſon of the cold Air it be much cooled, which you ſhall diſcern by the unnatural hardneſs of it, or if it be black, or of a livid colour, then it is to be bound up near to the warm and ſound part, and the corrupt part muſt be cut away. Let the Thread hang out at the Wound, until the corrupt part ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the whole. Then draw the Thread wholly out of the Wound. If the Caul be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altered, it will be ſufficient to thruſt it within the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> without binding. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that we uſe deligation, when we cut away any portion of the Caul: otherwiſe much Blood would fall into the capacity of the <hi>Abdomen:</hi> for the Caul ſeemeth to be a texture of Veins and Arteries enterlaced with fat.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſcope is to ſtitch the Wound. This kind of ſtitch is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Before you ſtitch, you muſt perform theſe three things. Firſt, you muſt have a elear light, that you may have a perfect view of the Wound: Secondly, you muſt lay the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent upon the ſide oppoſite to the Wound, that the Guts trouble you not, while you are ſtitching: Thirdly, that you have your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by you, to hold up the parts which you are to ſtitch.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being provided, go about your buſineſs: of this kind of ſtitch there be three uſual ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is thus performed: Firſt, the Needle is thruſt through the Skin and the Muſcles, even to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> not touching the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> on that ſide: then from within outwards, the Needle is to be thruſt through the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> and Muſcles of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide. Then within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an inch, the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is to be thruſt through the Muſcles of the ſame ſide, leaving the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> Afterwards from within outwards the Needle is to be thruſt through the <hi>Perltonaeum</hi> and the Muſcles. So you are to proceed until ſometimes piercing the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> and ſometimes ſparing it, you have ſufficiently united the parts disjoyned. Some, of four ſtitches make one Ligature, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Thread, and tying the ends of it firmly together, and uſe as many Ligatures as are ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is done by ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Muſcles together, and the ſides of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> together. In this ſort of ſtitch, firſt, the Needle is to be paſſed through the Skin and the Muſcles to the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum:</hi> then the oppoſite ſide of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is to be joyned to the ſide lying under the Muſcles pierced: this being done, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Muſcles are to be pierced, this courſe is to be followed until all the brims of the Wound be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently united.</p>
                     <p>The third differeth not from the ſtitch which is uſed in other parts of the Body: For the Needle is to be thruſt through two ſides of the Muſcles, and ſo many of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> ſtill, until ſufficient ſtitches be taken. The firſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the beſt. After ſtitching you leave an Orifice in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:52816:211"/>part to admit a Tent, that the matter procured by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration may be diſcharged. This kind of ſtitch is uſed, becauſe the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> being a Membrane would not admit Conſolidation without the entercourſe of fleſh. And if it were left unconſolidate, an uncurable Tumor would be left in the outer parts, the Guts inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating themſelves into the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>One thing is to be obſerved, that you ſecond and ſtrengthen this kind of ſtitch, by a drie ſtitch, and that very firm: for within a few days the thread will cut aſunder the brims ſtitched, and the ſtitches will become looſe, becauſe the inteſtines continually do butt upon the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the drie ſtitch is requiſite, as it is in the cure of the double Hare-lip.</p>
                     <p>The Third Intention was ſaid to be the application of convenient Topicks. Such are all choice vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Balſames, whereof I have ſpoken ſufficiently before, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Emplaſters, ſuch are <hi>Diapalma,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> newly made, and not too drie in the Summer-ſeaſon. In the Winter <hi>Emplaſtrum ſticticum</hi> is the beſt.</p>

The laſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of curing of theſe Wounds penetrating, wherein no contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part is wounded, was ſaid to be the ſhunning and hindring of evil Symptoms. Now theſe Symptoms are two: The pain of the parts adjacent being continual, and the collection of Quittour or Blood in the hollowneſs of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To avoid the firſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 4. adviſeth us to embrocate all the parts from the Arm-pits to the Groins with Sallet-Oil warmed: But it were better to embrocate thoſe parts with the Oil of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maemil, Roſes, and white Lilie, if they be to be had: for ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:52816:212"/>would be prevented, Pain would be eaſed, and the parts kept ſoft and pliable.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond accident, Blood and Quittour may fall from the brims of the Wound into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the Belly, and may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, not the Guts only, but all other parts contained alſo: for ſometimes a Tumor is cauſed, and ſometimes the Dropſie is procured. You ſhall know that theſe things are contained in the hollowneſs, Firſt, by the Weight which is felt there, the Pain, the Tenſion of the part: Secondly, if you cruſh the Belly, you ſhall perceive the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhift from place to place under your hands. Seeing this Matter cannot be ſenſibly emptied, becauſe the wounds of the Belly muſt not be kept open, for the reaſon ſet down before, when I ſpake of the ſtitching of theſe Wounds; we muſt labour inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to diſſipate it by Medicaments; which rarefie the parts, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and draw out the Matter: wherefore you may embrocate the Groins with Oil of Rue, Dill, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium,</hi> Wax, <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> of Tiles, Then you may apply <hi>Diachylum magnum cum Gummi</hi> ſoſtned with Oil of Scorpions, or <hi>Oxycroceum,</hi> and <hi>de Mucilaginibus</hi> mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of penetrating Wounds of the Belly, wherein ſome of the parts contained are wounded, and Firſt of the Wounds of the parts appointed for Chylification.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw the contained parts which are wounded, are either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for nutrition or procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If for nutrition, then they either procure Chylification, or help Sanguification. Thoſe which procure Chylification are the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and the Guts. The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach hath two parts, the Orifice, which is called <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and the bottom which is called <hi>Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> be wounded, then the Wounds are either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiary and ſmall, or elſe deep, and paſſing to the Cavity of it: And both theſe are either ſtreight or tranſverſe, and theſe either near to the Stomach, or ſomewhat remote from it.</p>
                     <p>Wounds ſmall, ſtreight, and which are ſomewhat remote from the bottom of the Stomach, are leſs dangerous; But thoſe which
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:52816:212"/>are great, tranſverſe, and neer to the bottom, are deadly; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no conſolidation. See <hi>Guido Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. for this theſe reaſons may be given. Firſt, becauſe the paſſing of the Meat and Drink doth hinder conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bedewed with moiſture deſcending ſtill, either from the Head, or from the Almonds. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe its Office is abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of life, that is, the carrying of the Meat and Drink to the bottom of the Stomach. This carrying of the Aliment is performed by impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and attraction. The external Membrane, which is fleſhy, and hath tranſverſe Fibres, doth thruſt it down; but the internal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which hath ſtreight Fibres, doth attract the nouriſhment. Wherefore the Fibres of both the Membranes being cut aſunder, the paſſing of the nouriſhment is ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo the party defrauded of Aliment. Fourthly, becauſe the Meat and Drink muſt be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vomiting, ſeeing it cannot paſs to the bottom of the Stomach. Fiſthly, when the upper nervous part of the <hi>Gula</hi> is wounded, which is nervous and of exquiſite ſenſe, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>Wounds in the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> are more dangerous than thoſe of the <hi>Ventriculus</hi> for theſe reaſons; Firſt, becauſe it is of a nervous and membranous ſubſtance, and ſo is not eaſily united. Secondly, Becauſe the pain is exceeding ſharp, and ſo depriveth one of reſt and ſleep. Thirdly, Becauſe it hath a great conſent with the Brain, by reaſon of the Nerves deſcending from the ſixth Conjugation, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon it. Fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Topicks cannot convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be applied to ſuch a Wound; yea, if you miniſter vulnerary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either they return by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, or ſlipping down make no ſtay, or elſe they iſſue out at the Wound. Fifthly, Appetite is loſt, and ſo the deſire of Meat and Drink, without which the life of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long continue. Sixthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Convulſions may enſue, which are deadly, according to <hi>Hippoc. Aphor. Sect.</hi> 5.2. Seventhly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vomiting of Choler doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, according to <hi>Celſus, loco ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato,</hi> which may enlarge and tear the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning the Wounds of the bottom of the Stomach, they have the ſame differences which thoſe of the Orifices have, which after the Prognoſticks, and manner of curing theſe wounds, receive theſe preſages.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſmall and ſuperficial wounds are eaſily cured; but penetrating
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:52816:213"/>Wounds are accounted deadly by <hi>Hippoc. Aphor.</hi> 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>Now this word <hi>Deadly</hi> hath a threefold ſignification; for Firſt, it ſignifies, that bringeth inevitable death; Secondly, it ſignifies, that which moſt commonly bringeth death; Thirdly, it ſignifies that which is dangerous, and may bring death. Now Wounds in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Stomach penetrating, are not always deadly in the firſt ſignification, although they be in the ſecond and third ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, penetrating wounds in the bottom of the Stomach are hard to be united: Firſt, becauſe it is of a membranous ſubſtance. Secondly, becauſe Meat and Drink keep aſunder the brims of the Wound. Thirdly, becauſe vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary potions ſlip out at the wounds. Fourthly, becauſe a convenient Ligature to keep the brims of the wound together, cannot be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fifthly, becauſe the Stomach is very ſenſible, from whence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Pain, afflux of Humors, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Inflammations. Sixthly, becauſe the Body cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the benefit which it affordeth to it, for it is the pot wherein the nouriſhment of the whole Body is boiled.</p>
                     <p>The Second preſage: Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wounds in the <hi>Ventriculus,</hi> are not ſo dangerous as thoſe of this kind in the <hi>Oeſophagus.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the bottom is more fleſhy. Secondly, becauſe vulnerary poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other Medicaments may longer ſtay here. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the dignity of this is not ſo great; for the Orifice is the ſeat of the Appetite. Fourthly, becauſe the bottom is not of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe as the Orifice. That Wounds in the bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may be cured, read <hi>Crollius in praefat. Baſil. Chymic. Schenkius, and others.</hi> It were too tedious to ſet down their narrations.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know that the bottom of the Stomach is wounded, Firſt, if the Wound be under the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> or the <hi>Mucronata carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago:</hi> Secondly, if the <hi>Chylus</hi> come out at the Wound either ſincere, or mingled with the Meat unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>As for the cure of theſe Wounds, you muſt not ſuffer the Tent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the wound of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: it muſt only keep open the parts lying above the Stomach. Let it be armed with a Digeſtive made of the Oil of <hi>Hypericum,</hi> Turpentine, and the yolk of an Egg; for this aſſwageth pain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth Quittour, and is glutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The Stomach outwardly is to be embrocated with Oil of Mint, Myrtils, Quinces, Wormwood, and Oil of Roſes; Let him drink the juice of Pomegranates and Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Syrups of them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Horſe-tail, Mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear, and Periwincle or Plantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water ſugared. To poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you may preſcribe Poſſet-drink, wherein theſe Herbs have been boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Let the party Drink and Eat very ſparingly; for the Wound will better unite when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is ſomewhat empty and wrinkled together.</p>
                     <p>If the Guts be wounded, then they are either the ſmall or great Guts. If the ſmall be wounded, the <hi>Chylus</hi> comes out at the wound,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:52816:213"/>the Flanks ſwell and become hard, the Hicket troubles the Patient; be vomits Choler; he hath great gripings in his Belly; oftentimes a cold Sweat breaks out, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts cold.</p>
                     <p>If the great Guts be wounded, the Excrements come out at the Wound. Now the wounds of the Guts are either ſuperficiary, or they paſs to the Cavity. If they paſs to the Cavity, then they are either ſtreight or tranſverſe, and theſe either great or ſmall.</p>
                     <p>This being noted, you may thus correcture of the event: Firſt, if the Wound be but ſuperficiary; yet it is not altogether without danger; becauſe all the external parts of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are divided. Secondly, great Wounds of the Guts, but chiefly if they be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſe, for the moſt part prove deadly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe they are of a membranous ſubſtance, which hath but little Blood. Secondly, becauſe the <hi>Chylus</hi> and excrements do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually paſs by them. Thirdly, becauſe local Medicaments cannot conveniently be applied to them, partly becauſe they lie deep in the Body, partly becauſe they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ally change place. Fourthly, becauſe the brims are kept aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they being diſtended by flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, the <hi>Chylus</hi> and the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Fifthly, becauſe their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of the life of Man; for either they diſtribute the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which is performed by the ſmall Guts, or elſe they contain and diſcharge the Excrements, which the great do: But theſe are hindred, the Guts being wounded. Sixthly, becauſe they are very ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſo Pain, Inflammations, Fevers, and Watching may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
                     <p>The third preſage: Wounds of the ſmall Guts are more dangerous than thoſe of the great: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more nervous and membranous than the great. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they are of a more exquiſite Senſe. Thirdly, becauſe they are nearer to the Stomach. Fourthly, becauſe they have more meſaraical Veins. Fifthly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their excellent Office; for they diſtribute the <hi>Chylus,</hi> and more reſine it, according to <hi>Galen</hi> 4. <hi>de uſ. part. c.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p>The fourth preſage: Amongſt theſe are the Wounds of the <hi>Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it hath more meſaraical Veins than the reſt, which makes it look red. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it may be ſoon infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by reaſon of the plenty of Blood. Thirdly, becauſe it is next to the Liver, and ſo ſooneſt inflamed. Fourthly, becauſe it hath a tenderer ſubſtance than the reſt. Fifthly, becauſe it receiveth immediately and in full force, the ſharp Choler from the Gall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the reſt receive it but mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the ſharpneſs of it being much abated.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Preſage: The great Guts are more apt to receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation than the ſmall; partly becauſe they are of a more fleſhy ſubſtance: partly becauſe they are not ſo ſenſible: And Thirdly, the Excrements contained in them are ſolider than the <hi>Chylus,</hi> and ſo not ſo apt to flow to the wounded part, and ſo to keep the brims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:52816:214"/>
                     <p>As for the cure of theſe Wounds, they require four Intentions. The Firſt is to ſtitch the brims of the Wound with the Glovers-ſtitch; if the Gut be not without the Wound, it muſt be drawn out gently: Let it be ſown with good flaxen thread not waxed; for then it will ſwell and not ſo ſoon cut the brims of the Wound aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to reduce the Gut to its own place, but it muſt firſt be fomented with red aſtringent Wine warmed: Secondly, an agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Medicament is to be applied to the Wound, ſuch is this: ℞ <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich. Sarcecoll. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>Borac. &amp; Myrrh. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>fiat. ſ. a. pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis. qui aſpergatur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the external parts of the Belly are to be ſtitched, as I have taught in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Better it is to ſtitch theſe parts than to leave them open. Firſt, becauſe you cannot any more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply local Medicaments to the Wound; for the Guts ſtill ſhift. Secondly, becauſe the Air will cauſe pain and griping. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cold Air may breed fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity, which diſtending the Guts, may break the ſtitches. Fourthly, becauſe the natural heat being kept in, the Gut is ſooner conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Intention is; you muſt have a care that the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hurt not the Wound, they becoming hard by ſtaying. To this purpoſe you muſt feed the Patient with moiſtning Meats, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter emollient Clyſters, made of the decoctions of a Sheeps-Head and Feet. In curing of theſe Wounds, you muſt not admit the miniſtring of vulnerary poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>What will befall, the Liver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, theſe Aphoriſms fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing will ſhew you. Firſt, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciary wounds of the Liver may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit cure: but great and deep Wounds will not. <hi>Hip. Aph.</hi> 18. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. hath theſe words: <hi>If the Bladder, or the Brain, or the Heart, or the Midriff, or a ſmall Gut, or the Stomach, or the Liver be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sundry reaſons may be alledged for this. Firſt, is the great Flux of Blood which follows. Secondly, the Inflammation which poſſeſſes it being wounded; for it is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hot and full of Blood. The Third is the difficulty of Cure: for Vulnerary potions loſe much of their ſtrength before they come to the Liver.</p>
                     <p>Topicks cannot well be applied, it lying deep, and the Quittour cannot be well diſcharged, and ſo it may corrupt the ſubſtance of the Liver, and ſo Sanguification is diſturbed, from whence enſue the Conſumption of the Body, or the Dropſie.</p>
                     <p>If you object that good Authors have in their Monuments ſet down Examples of ſome who have been cured, who have received a deep Wound in the Liver.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that thoſe Examples
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:52816:215"/>are rare, and come near to Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, God his providence concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the extraordinary ſtrong conſtitution of the Body: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not theſe draw from you any bountiful promiſe of recovery.</p>
                     <p>The Second preſage, If cold Sweats burſt out of the Forehead and Neck, if the wounded party often faint, if the Extremities grow cold, and the party become very weak, then death attends.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Cure, let it be dreſſed with aſtringent Trochiſcs diſſolved in Plantain-water, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto Syrups of dry Roſes, Myrtils, and Poniegranates: for a doubtful hope is better than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved deſpair.</p>
                     <p>The Second part helping San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification, which may be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the Spleen: for according to <hi>Ariſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de part. animalium,</hi> it is a baſtard Liver. The wounds of it as of the Liver are either ſuperficiary or deep. Signs of the Spleen wounded deeply, are theſe according to <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 26. Black Blood doth iſſue out of the left Side, the Side it ſelf and the Stomach become hard, great Thirſt enſues, and the pain reaches to the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Prognoſticks, Firſt, deep Wounds of the Spleen are for the moſt part deadly. <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 26. affirms, that they who are ſo wounded hardly are ever cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for this Prognoſtick theſe reaſons may be given: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſearful flux not only of the venal, but of the arterial Blood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth enſue. Secondly, it is a worthy and neceſſary part, it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Sanguification, and being a ſecond Liver, if it perform not its Duty.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe it being a part full of Blood and hot, it may be eaſily inflamed. Fourthly, becauſe it hath a great conſent with the Heart, by reaſon of the multitude of the Arteries communicate with it: for noiſome vapours may be ſent to the Heart, from the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and putrefied Blood.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond preſage; although deep wounds of the Spleen be dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet I am of the opinion that the Spleen may be cut out of a Man, or a Woman, and the party may live. The experiment of this exſection in a Dog, Mr. <hi>Gillam</hi> and I made in Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Houſe. Firſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilion was made in the left Side, hard under the ſhort Ribs, four Inches in length through all the containing parts of the <hi>Abdomen:</hi> then the Spleen was drawn out: Thirdly, all the veſſels by which it was bound to the adjacent and contiguous parts, we bound, to prevent the immoderate flux of Blood: Fourthly, we cut away the Spleen near to the ſubſtance of it. Fifthly, we ſtitched the parts of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and left the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the parts to Nature; all the wounded parts were in a ſhort time healed. But about ſix weeks afterward the Cur became Mangie, the Spleen belike not drawing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf the ſaeculent Blood. <hi>Vidus Vidius de curat, memb. li.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 10. thinks this operation to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with keeping of life, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the immoderate flux of Blood which muſt enſue. But the binding of the veſſels doth remove this ſcruple, which I wonder he did not conſider.</p>

                     <p>The wounds of the Spleen are cured as thoſe of the Liver: It falls out in wounds of the Liver and Spleen, that much Blood falls into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> But this Blood is either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by the natural heat, or elſe it cauſes an Apoſteme in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>The Third part aſſiſting Sungui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the Kidney; This may be wounded either ſuperficially, or deeply; and ſo either where the <hi>Carunculae papillares</hi> only are; or to the <hi>Pelvis</hi> alſo, and this laſt either without any hurt done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vein and Artery emulgent, to they being wounded alſo.</p>
                     <p>If the Kidnies be wounded to the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> clots of Blood will come with the Urine: there will be a great pain in the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will reach to the Groin and Teſticle.

                     <p>If the Wound be inflicted by the Side, and pierce but only to the <hi>Carunculae papillares,</hi> it may be cuted, and yet not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, becauſe the Muſcles of the Belly muſt be wounded, and the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> alſo, between the Membranes of which it is lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>If the Wound pierce to the <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> the Wound moſt commonly falls out to be deadly: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the draining of the Seroſity from the Veins and Arteries is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary: otherwiſe if it be ſtaied in the Body, it would hinder the unition of the Wound, and procure wateriſh Powks and the Dropſie. Secondly, becauſe the ſubſtance of it hardly doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit conſolidation, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the compactneſs of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, partly becauſe it hath within it ſelf the <hi>Carunculae papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares</hi> and the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> which are ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick parts.</p>
                     <p>If the Vein and Artery emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent be wounded, there is ſmall hope of recovery, becauſe a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flux of Blood muſt enſue.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is performed by ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive injections, vulnerary poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the miniſtring of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſci de alkekengi cum opio;</hi> or if the pain be not great, <hi>ſine opio</hi> in new Milk, having <hi>Saccharum roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> diſſolved in it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Wounds of the Nervous Parts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the Nervous Parts, here I underſtand three ſorts of parts: to wit, Nerves, Tendons and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>That a Nerve is wounded, you ſhall know firſt by the part: If great and many Nerves be in the place wounded, or paſs by it; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy teacheth this. Secondly, you ſhall know this by the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, for there will enſue a Pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Inflammation, Convulſion, Raving, if it be cut aſunder, and at laſt ſometimes Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Solutions of Unity which happen unto Nerves, are four; a Puncture, an Inciſion, a Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Diſtortion.</p>
                     <p>Of the Wounds of Nerves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Prognoſticks: Firſt, Wounds of the Nerves are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Firſt, becauſe they are of an exquiſite ſenſe or feeling, both becauſe the Membrane, wherewith they are covered, proceeds from <hi>Meninges,</hi> and that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with plenty of Animal Spirits. Secondly, by reaſon of the conſent which they have with the Brain, and the <hi>Spinalis Medulla:</hi> For according to <hi>Galen, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>de uſu partium c.</hi> 11. the Brain is the Well-ſpring, the <hi>Spinalis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla</hi> the River, and the Nerves the Creeks. Thirdly, by reaſon of the fearful ſigns, which follow after that a Nerve is wounded, which are extreme pain, afflux of Humors, a Gangrene, a ſharp Fever, Raving, and a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>As for a Puncture, it is either not conſpicuous, not to be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſight; or it is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: The firſt is called <hi>Punctura Caeca;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Punctura A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perta:</hi> of the two, the <hi>Caeca</hi> is the worſt; for local Medicaments cannot ſo well be applied to the part wounded.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the cure of this particular Solution of Unity in Nerves, I will acquaint you with the general indications required in the cure of Wounds of Nervous Parts in general: Firſt, Blood is to be let. Secondly, the Body is to be purged: See <hi>Galen, c.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Method. Aeginet. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 54. theſe prevent the afflux of Humors. Thirdly, the party muſt uſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlender Diet. Fourthly, we muſt provide that the Air which the Patient doth enjoy, be warm; for if Air be cold, a Convulſion muſt enſue. Peruſe <hi>Apher.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Wherefore when you dreſs
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52816:217"/>ſuch Wounds, you are to uſe warm Cloaths and Stupes, and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments warmed.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to the cure of a Puncture in particular: if it be <hi>Punctura Caeca,</hi> theſe local Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are apt. Theſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be hot, drying, of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til parts, to digeſt, dry putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and attract.

Euphorb. part.</hi> 12. According to the tenderneſs or the hardneſs of the Body, more or leſs of the <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is to be uſed. You ſhall know your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament to be proportionate to the grief; Firſt, if the party feel a pleaſant heat, as is that of the Sun in temperate weather: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the party do pleaſantly itch. If the party feel no heat, then there can be no attraction; if it be immoderate, it will attract Humors, and cauſe Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>If by the Application of theſe Medicaments, the Pain and other Symptoms ceaſe not, then croſs inciſion of the Skin is to be made, that the Medicaments in their full force may be applied to the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Nerve. When the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is either thus laid bare by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or at the firſt by the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruments; it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to apply to it Medicaments ſo hot and drying, and when it is hid to ſhun Inflammation: Wherefore your ordinary artificial Balſam dropped in warm will ſerve; for by this Unctuoſity they ſmooth the part, by their Heat they make attraction, and ſo mitigate Pain by diſcharging the place of the <hi>Sanies,</hi> and by their Moiſture they open the Orifice, and keep it open.</p>
                     <p>The Inciſion of the Nerve is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtreight and direct, or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. If it be tranſverſe, it is either quite cut aſunder, or but in part.</p>
                     <p>A Nerve quite divided is leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, than that which is but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut in part, according to <hi>Guid. Magn.

                           </gap>mpholygos.</hi> If the whole Nerve be cut aſunder, no Convulſion can enſue, becauſe both the ends give way. This kind of Wound is cured eaſily by ſarcotical Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof I have ſpoken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſufficiently. In this kind of Wound the motion of the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Nerve is implanted to move, is aboliſhed. If the Nerve be cut aſunder but in part, firſt it is to be dreſſed with the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before preſcribed; but if the Symptoms, as Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a Convulſion he like to enſue, the beſt courſe is to cut the Nerve or Tendon quite aſunder rather than by deferring of the Inciſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the party wounded to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death. This being done, uſe Anodyne and deſiccative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments. When you have thus dreſſed the Wound above your Pledgets, either in <hi>Diapalma</hi> or <hi>Diachylon ſimplex</hi> in the Summer malaxed with the Oyl of Roſes, Quinces, or Myrtils; for the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the part will hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the application of any firm Emplaſter. Laſt of all, you are to roll up the part with <hi>Faſcia Expulſiva,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken in its proper place, partly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Santes</hi> which doth gather in the place, partly to ſtay the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion of new Humors.</p>
                     <p>Now it is time to come to the Contuſion of a Nerve. This may be either a ſolitary, or with ſome Solution of Unity. If it be ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then you are to foment the part with Sallet-Oyl hot, and to apply it with Wooll. If the Skin be divided, then Medicaments drying and uniting the parts are to be uſed. Such is <hi>Emplaſtrum Fodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis</hi> malaxed with Oyl of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, a diſtortion may happen to a Nerve by a fall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary motion, or ſome other violent external cauſe, which may hinder the motion of the part. In this caſe apply <hi>Emplaſtrum de mucilaginibus,</hi> or <hi>Diapalma,</hi> having <hi>Gummi Ammoniacum</hi> added to it.</p>
                     <p>After Contuſion and Diſtortion of Nerves, a hardneſs often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which cauſes a numneſs of the part. This proceeds from the ſetling of groſs Humors in the place. In this caſe you are to uſe Medicaments which ſoften and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, as the Oyl of white Lillies, Gooſe-greaſe with <hi>Bd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>llium;</hi> but the Oyl of Sheeps and Neats-feet impregnate with the Mucilage of Marſh-mallow, Linſeed and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, exceeds all other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let the part be embrocated with this Medicament warmed; and let <hi>Emplaſtrum magnum cum Gummi</hi> malaxed with <hi>Storax li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quida</hi> be applied. Now it remains that I ſpeak ſomewhat of accidents which uſually fall out when a Nerve is wounded.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: you muſt meet with this by applying Medicaments, which are cooling and drying; for theſe both abate the Inflammation, and correct Putrefaction, ſuch are
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:52816:218"/>Bean-meal, Barley-flowre, the Meal of Vetches, Cich-peaſe, or Millet boiled with ſufficient ſtore of <hi>Oxymel,</hi> until they be brought to the conſiſtence of a Poultice. But before you apply this Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Member, embrocate it with Oyl of Elders, having min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it a little Roſe-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Symptom is Pain: Here you muſt uſe liberal Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, purging, and a ſpare Diet. If the party cannot admit Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then Ventoſes with Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Leeches, Veſicatories in the oppoſite parts; for a local Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, uſe a Cataplaſm made of Bean-flowre, Mallows, Groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Violet-leaves boiled in Milk, and having <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Populeum</hi> mingled with the Cataplaſm, when it is taken from the fire.</p>
                     <p>The third Symptom which may trouble both you and the Patient is a Convulſion: Of this Accident <hi>Hippocrates Aphor.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. ſo pronounceth: <hi>If a Convulſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon a Wound, it is deadly.</hi> But this muſt happen after too great effuſion of Blood, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth himſelf in the next A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm; for if a Convulſion fall out by reaſon of repletion, it is cured by bringing the Body low, by uſing the general curative means in that meaſure as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhall ſhew. If a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion happen, then you muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocate all the <hi>Spinalis Medulla</hi> from the Head to the <hi>Coccyx</hi> with Sallet-Oyl warmed, and afterwards applying Rolls of Wooll, or a Sheeps-skin, newly killed, to the part: Then the Member wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is alſo to be dreſſed; ſo if the Wound be in the hand, you muſt begin to foment in the Arm-pits, by which the Nerves march, and then to proceed to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck and Breaſt with Oyl and Wooll. But if the Foot be wounded, then you muſt begin the Fomentation at the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and ſo proceed to the ends of the Toes. It is not amiſs to hold the whole Member in warm Oyl, as in a Bath, if it may conveniently be done. So much then of Wounds of a Nerve.</p>
                     <p>If a Tendon be wounded, you ſhall perceive it by theſe two Signs: The firſt is, if the Wound be near to the Joints, for the Tendons are the endings of the Muſcles, and the ends of Muſcles ever end ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Joints, or near to them. The ſecond is, if the Wound be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in parts which are not fleſhy: ſuch are the Backs of the Hands and Feet. As for the cure of theſe Wounds, the indications ſet down in the Cure of the Wounds of a Nerve will ſerve.</p>
                     <p>If Ligaments be wounded, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are not ſo ſenſible as thoſe of the Nerves and Tendons, they procure not ſo fearful Accidents: only drying Medicaments, and not too hot, are here to be uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the <hi>Sanies,</hi> leſt the Ligament rot. Stronger Medicaments may here be uſed, becauſe a Tendon is not ſo ſenſible; in this caſe uſe Oyl of Maſtick, the natural Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, artificial Balſam, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſolidating Powders; above apply <hi>Emplaſtrum Fodicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</hi> In curing of theſe Wounds which happen to the Nervous parts, take heed that you uſe not a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52816:219"/>for that moiſtens and increaſes Putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>This one thing let me inſinuate unto you, that if one be offered to you, who hath the great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, inſerted into the Heel wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you ſuffer him not to walk before it be perfectly united and skinned, for otherwiſe it will break open again.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Wounds of the Joints.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Joint is the ſetting together of Bones for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of free motion according to <hi>Galen, lib. de Oſſibus in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Wounds of the Joints are made either by a Puncture or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifion; and theſe are either in the upper compaſſing parts, or elſe they pierce to the cavity of the Joint. The Solution of Unity in the Joints is apparent to the Eye: wherefore it is needleſs to ſet down ſigns.</p>
                     <p>As for the Prognoſticks receive theſe: All Wounds of the Joints are dangerous: Firſt, becauſe they are of an exquiſite ſenſe; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Nerves, Tendons, and Membranes: wherefore ſharp pains do enſue, which procure affluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humors, from whence ſpring Inflammations, Fevers, watchings; loathing of Food, Thirſt, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Gangrenes, weakneſs, and ſometimes Death. Secondly, as all Wounds of the Joints are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, ſo great Wounds piercing to the cavity are moſt dangerous, yea moſt commonly, if they be inflicted into great Joints, and the <hi>Aqua Articularis,</hi> the Joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water iſſue out. Of this Water, ſee <hi>Celſ. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 26. <hi>Par. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 39. <hi>Lang. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ep. in praef. &amp; lib. eod. ep.</hi> 4. <hi>Plat. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>prax. fol.</hi> 782. <hi>&amp;</hi> 933. <hi>&amp;</hi> 737. After that this natural Humor is let out, then ſucceedeth the iſſuing of an excrementitious Humor. <hi>Celſus</hi> affirms it either to be a thin whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <hi>Ichor,</hi> or to be a glutinous and whitiſh Humor, like to white Honey, which he calls <hi>Meliceria.</hi> This term by him, <hi>lib. cod.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. is taken for a kind of Ulcer. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaith that this Excrement is ſometimes thick and white, and ſometimes thin. <hi>Langius</hi> liken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to Whey. <hi>Platerus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreth it to be a wateriſh <hi>Ichor.</hi> This diverſity doth proceed from the diverſity of the temperature of the Bodies of wounded perſons. It is cold and moiſt, and is cauſed of the elementary Juice, which is ſent to no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> riſh the Joint: but it is corrupted by the weakneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature of the Joint wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:52816:219"/>
                     <p>A Queſtion may here be moved, why a greater quantity of Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour doth flow out of a Joint wounded, than out of another part, if the quantities of the Wounds be equal.</p>
                     <p>Many reaſons may be alleged for this: Firſt, the Pain which follows after a Wound in the Joint, is ſo grievous, that it makes a greater attraction of Humors: Secondly, the Joints are of a ſubſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fleſh and Blood, and of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature cold, ſo that they cannot concoct the ſuperfluous Humors which do flow thither, nor turn them to a laudable Quittour: Thirdly, by reaſon of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they cannot ſo forcibly repel the Humors flowing, as other fleſhy Members can, by reaſon of their heat: Fourthly, their ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on furthers the admiſſion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Humors much, they being ſeated in a dependent part.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cure, if it be a Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, it is to be dreſſed as the Puncture of a Nerve or Tendon: Shun cold, relaxing, moiſtning and unctuous Topicks, unleſs Pain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force you to uſe Anodyne means. Cold nips Wounds, hardens the Skin, hinders Suppuration, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the natural heat, cauſes blackneſs, brings Aguiſh Fits, and Convulſions. Peruſe <hi>Hippoc. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. If the Wound be procured by Inciſion, then either the brims are reaſonable near one to another, or elſe they gape much, being much ſeparate. If they be far aſunder, then you muſt uſe ſtitching fuſt of all to bring the brims together; you muſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtitch the Skin in Perſons of ripe Age, but in Children you may ſtitch the ſubjacent parts; for in ſuch they will admit Unition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen.</hi> 2. <hi>de fractur.</hi> Affirms, that all parts of the Body delight to be covered with the Skin, which Nature hath provided for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cover. If this may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of any, it may be moſt juſtly pronounced of the Joints, for they have but ſmall ſtore of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, which may be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, if the cold Air be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pierce unto them; which is hindered by bringing the brims of the Wound together by ſtitching. When the Wound is ſtitched, there muſt be left a ſmall Orifice in the depending part to admit a Tent, that the Quittour may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                     <p>This being done, if the Wound pierce not to the cavity of the Joint, dreſs the Wound with ſome good artificial Balſam, having mingled with it a drying and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder; ſuch is this; ℞ <hi>Thur. ſan. Dracon. Myrrh. Aloes Hepat. Maſtich. an.</hi>

This is excellent to prevent Pain, or to aſſwage it if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. All the Applications muſt be actually hot: for actual heat doth concoct and diſcuſs excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Humors in the Joints and ſtrengthneth them. If the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:52816:220"/>Wound pierce to the cavity of the Joint, the Medicaments muſt be very drying: firſt, becauſe the Boues and Ligaments whereof the Joints are framed, are of their own nature very dry, and ſo require dry Medicaments: Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not feeling, and ſo may ſuffer very ſtrong Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Thirdly, becauſe plenty of thin Quittour is gathered in Wounds of the Joints, a very drying Medicament is required.</p>
                     <p>Uſe then greater quantity of the former Powder with the Balſam, or mingle it with <hi>Arcaeus</hi> his Liniment, and above apply the former Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</p>
                     <p>Let me give you notice of one thing, that in curing of a Wound of the Joint you have a ſpecial care of the poſition of the Member, for a perverſe poſture increaſeth Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and bringeth Diſtortion, Numneſs, and Contraction ſundry times, after that the Wound is cured. Wherefore if the upper part of the ſhoulder be wounded, a large Boulſter muſt be put in the Arm-pit, and the arm carried in a Scarf to bear up the lower part of the Arm, that the brims of the Wound may the more aptly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate. If the lower part of the Arm be wounded, you muſt carry it in a poſture, mean between ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion and contraction. And when the lips of the Wound begin to unite, you muſt cauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to uſe a moderate motion of the Arm, leſt it prove leſs plyable to motion, after that the Wound is cured. If the Joint of the Elbow be wounded, it muſt be ſo placed that it be neither too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, nor too much extended.</p>
                     <p>The German Chirurgeons here are very ſcrupulous in Wounds of the <hi>Muſculus biceps,</hi> which they call <hi>die Mauſs,</hi> or the Mouſe, for the likeneſs it hath with a Mouſe, for it hath a ſmall tendinous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending, but a thick fleſhy Belly. They eſteem the Wounds of this Muſcle, which with the <hi>Brachiaeus</hi> doth bend the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to be deadly: Thus I would have you to diſtinguiſh. It may be wounded both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Head and Tail, and in the Belly alſo. Wounds in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and inſertion of it are moſt dangerous, becauſe theſe parts are tendinous, and ſo of an exquiſite feeling; it is double in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. If a Wound be inflicted in the Belly of this Muſcle, it is leſs dangerous, becauſe it is fleſhy, yet a great flux of Blood may enſue, becauſe it hath remarkable Veins and Arteries, and great pain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath not ſmall Twigs of the Nerve. If the Wreſts or Joints of the Fingers be wounded, they muſt be kept half ſhut, moving a Ball in the Palm of the Hand; for if they be kept ſtill extended they may prove unable to gripe when they are healed.</p>
                     <p>If the Articulation of the Hip be wounded, the Thigh Bone muſt be kept in its cavity, which may be done by laying the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on his back, and applying fit Boulſters and Rollers. If the Knee be wounded, it muſt be kept ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, if the party will not have the Member contracted after the Wound healed. When the Joints of the Toes are wounded, they are to be in their natural poſture, not bending of them inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52816:220"/>To conclude the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing of Wounds in the Joints, if they paſs to the Cavity, although they be cured, yet the Member will remain ſtiff.</p>
                     <p>Seeing Wounds are accounted great for four reſpects: Firſt, by reaſon of the greatneſs of the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity. Secondly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Excellency of the part. Thirdly, by reaſon of the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the party wounded. Fourthly, by reaſon of the grievous Symptoms. In the firſt and two laſt reſpects Wounds of the Joints may prove great.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing Wounds may four manner of ways cauſe Death. Firſt, if the office of the part be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that of the Lungs. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the part be excellent, as the Brain. Thirdly, if the flux of Blood cannot be ſtaid, as are the Wounds of the Liver, and the great Veſſels. Fourthly, if evil Symptoms do follow, as appeareth in Wounds of the Bladder. Wounds in the Joints, moſt commonly prove deadly for the fourth cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Before I put an end to this Treatiſe of Wounds, wherein I have perſiſted the longer, becauſe it is an object whereabout Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons are moſt frequently buſied, I will ſpeak ſomewhat of Vulnerary Potions, becauſe I have often made mention of them, and have ſet down the deſcription of ſome in the cure of ſome dangerous and great Wounds.</p>
                     <p>As for their qualities they are drying, familiar to the natural heat, and radical moiſture, and by a ſecret faculty they correct malignity.</p>
                     <p>The operations of them are theſe, they do purifie the Blood, cleanſing it from all impurities, and excrementitious Humors, they cleanſe Wounds and Ulcers alſo, they agglutinate broken Bones, and unite Nerves, they haſten the ſcaling of Bones; they procure the expulſion of ſtrange Bodies in Wounds; they diſſolve clotted Blood; they dry up ſuperfluous Humidity, and withſtand Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Let no man wonder, that they have ſuch admirable effects. We know that there are Meats and Drinks, yea Medicaments which are hurtful in ſome Diſeaſes, and at ſome times, as in a burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to drink Wine, or to miniſter hot or obſtructing Medicaments: Shall we not then think that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath provided means helpful and profitable in Griefs, unleſs we will take her to be rather a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother than a loving Mother?</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing GOD, by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did fore-ſee, that Man would fall and become mortal, and that Diſeaſes (the means to bring a Man to his end) would increaſe; of his own goodneſs, he, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, created means to ſecond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt Diſeaſes, and to defer Death by prolonging Life by uſe of ſuch things as are familiar to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contrary to the Grief: ſuch are Vulnerary Potions in Wounds.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Whence the Reaſon of Mortal Wounds is to be taken, what Wounds are ſafe, and what indifferent.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SEveral there are, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſlight, or however not a Mortal Wound, contrary to all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion die, which Caſe, when it comes before a Judge and Jury, may not a little perplex them, in determining the true Cauſe of the Parties death. Now if in the Verdict and Sentence the Aggreſſors are pronouced guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of uncertain Murther, Juſtice and the Laws are violated: But again ſhould the Guilty be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it would alſo be unjuſt not to give a Murtherer his deſert. And becauſe in ſuch Difficulties Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgeons are often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited, that Courts of Judicature may be their aſſiſtence proceed
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:52816:222"/>more clearly in ſuch Trials; my deſign in this <hi>Appendix</hi> to Wounds is, to ſhew by what Means and Methods it may be deprehended, whether the Party upon whom an Inqueſt ſits, died of a wound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or the intervention of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil. Now, that this enquiry may be full, I ſhall firſt ſay ſomething of the Mortality and other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Wounds. Afterwards, how it comes to paſs, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Men die of very ſlight Wounds. And laſt of all; how the Partie's death may be laid not ſo much to the Wound, as to ſeveral other occaſions of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, in reference to my purpoſe, I make a triple dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Wounds. Some are mortal: Some ſafe: And others are of a middle nature, which may be called dangerous. As for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wounds, though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> have plainly declared, what are ſo, and whence they are ſuch: Yet becauſe there are ſome, and thoſe men of Note, who have introduced I know not what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Wounds, whereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome might be perverted in their judgment of things, I ſhall ſay the more concorning this matter. Theſe men, as <hi>Franc. Valeriol. gener. med. cap.</hi> 8. write, that Mortal Wounds proceed not only from the nature of the wounded Part, but alſo from the Eſſence of the Wound, from its Magnitude, from a complication of Symptoms, and from the proper differences of Solution of Unity. But upon my conſulting the great Maſters of Medicine, and mature conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things themſelves, it appears that Wounds may not improperly be judged and called Mortal from the nature of the Parts alone. And indeed it is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Eſſence of a Wound, which conſiſts in the freſh Solution of Unity of ſome ſoft part, is the ſame every where: for a Wound is as much a Wound in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock as in the Heart, and bears the ſame Character and Nature. Wherefore, were it true that any Wound were in its Eſſence Mortal, all Wounds would always be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and none Salubrious. Nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is any Wound mortal from its magnitude; but only great or little; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which differ much from Mortal: for oftentimes a great Wound may be ſafe, and a little one deſtructive. Yet, whereas they ſay, a Wound may be called Mortal from ſupervening Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, this bears ſome ſemblance of Truth: for if grievous Symptoms ſupervene, every one knows, ſuch a man is mortally affected. But in very deed no Wound has from the Symptoms any thing why it ſhould be mortal: For ſuppoſe one were wounded in his Finger, and an Inflammation or Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſing upon it, he ſhould die, muſt the Wound therefore be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mortal? So all Wounds might be ſaid to be mortal: For, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> truly writes, 2. <hi>Praedict. Men die of all ſorts of Wounds, though in ignoble places, and that they ſeem in nothing grievous.</hi> Therefore ſupervening Symptoms may bring Death; but they can never alter the nature of a Wound. For the ſame reaſon alſo, if after a man has received a mortal Wound in his Brain, he for all that recovers; yet a Wound can
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:52816:222"/>never be conſtituted mortal for the preſence of Symptoms, nor ſafe for their abſence. And upon that ſcore I conclude the nature of a mortal Wound from the Parts. Beſides, <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whoſe ſingle judgment is to me worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, in 2. <hi>Praedict. circa medium,</hi> 6. <hi>Aphor.</hi> and in <hi>Coac. Praenot.</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing much of Mortal Wounds, takes their differences from the nature of the wounded Part, and never from any thing elſe. And as to this thing, whatever I could hitherto get out of the nature of the things, the teſtimony of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and my own obſervations, the ſum of all is this. All Parts that hold a Principality in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and are Fountains of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, namely, the Heart, Brain and Liver, If at any time they be wounded, they make a Wound Mortal. I may alſo among theſe reckon the Stomach, for the great neceſſity of its Action, ſince the Ancients, as <hi>Q. Serenus Sammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> calls it <hi>Rex Corporis.</hi> Nor would I exclude out of this rank the Spinal Marrow, as having much affinity with the Brain: For it is as another Brain to all the Parts below the Head. In the ſecond rank I place all thoſe Parts, which once divided never grow together again, and yet exerciſe ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary action of Life; ſuch as the Diaphragm, ſmall Guts, and the Bladder. In the third I put ſuch Parts as are endowed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, ſuch as is eſpecially the Mouth of the Stomach. And in the laſt place I put all ſuch Parts, as may by their large effuſion of Blood or Spirits deſtroy Life, ſuch as the Veins and Arteries. But here you may ſtick a little in the Mire. For ſince inviſible Wounds in theſe parts ſcarce ever bring Death, without the intervention of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, you might juſtly ſuppoſe that the differences of Mortal Wounds might be taken from the Symptoms. To this I ſay, that theſe Symptoms, through whoſe intervention wounded perſons ſeem to die, do always follow the nature of the wounded Part. For if the Mouth of the Stomach be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Syncope,</hi> by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſupervening, deſtroys the Party; ſo the wounded Brain kills by a Convulſion, Apoplexy, or ſome ſuch Symptom; Arteries and Veins by effuſion of Blood. Wherefore the whole reaſon of Mortal Wounds depends upon the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Parts, and in their Wounds whatever Symptoms ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene, they follow ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain property of the ſame parts. Beſides, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> their diſtinction of Wounds into <hi>Mortal of neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>Mortal for the moſt part,</hi> if you conſider it aright, ſeems to be taken from the very nature of the Parts. For thoſe Wounds are Mortal of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which are inflicted on the more noble or very ſenſible Parts, or whoſe uſe is altogether expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Animal: ſuch are mortal for the moſt part, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on leſs noble parts: And ſuch are ſafe, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays want danger, which tend, as much as in them lies, to recovery; but theſe have a great Latitude on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Majority or Minority. They that are in the middle place <hi>Galen</hi> calls dangerous; and he ſays, they are ſuch as have an
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:52816:223"/>equal tendency to Life or Death: Hither Wounds termed <hi>Cacoethe,</hi> or malignant, may be referred, to wit, ſuch as are contumacious to cure: And ſuch as the Learned have called indifferent, and of a middle nature. To this kind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo theſe Wounds may be reduced which we mentioned from <hi>Galen</hi> to be for the moſt part Mortal; but from which their ſlightneſs deducts much of the danger; ſuch are they which ſlightly touch the extreme part of the Liver, or the <hi>Meninges.</hi> Thus much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, now I proceed to particulars, where all things ſhall be made more clear.</p>

                     <p>Wounds of the Brain are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal upon two accounts; becauſe it is a principal part, and Original of the Animal Faculty; and becauſe it uſually cauſes many and grievous Symptoms. For becauſe it is a principal part, the Spirits are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhauſted, and the harm is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the whole Body: And grievous Symptoms proceed from inflammation, and from intercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Animal Faculty. By Wounds of the Brain I underſtand ſuch as reach to its ſubſtance, and ſuch as only reach to the <hi>Meninges.</hi> And the Nature of them is ſuch, that if the Wound be not all the bigger, they do not of neceſſity, but for the moſt part carry a Man off. And leſt I ſhould be thought to ſpeak without Book, I will give you ſome Authorities. I have ſeen, ſays <hi>Galen,</hi> a wounded Brain often cured; and once in <hi>Smyrna</hi> of <hi>Ionia</hi> a very conſiderable one: But this is very rare. He writes alſo, that this perſon received the Wound in the fore Ventricle of his Brain, but that he could not have recovered, had he been wounded in both.

For the Membranes that cover the Brain, under the right Suture of the Scull, deſcend double into the midſt of the Brain, ſeparating the right ſide from the left, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Interſtice, ſo that if the Sword were thruſt in juſt between theſe two Membranes, no wonder if the Wound were not mortal: for I ſuppoſe ſuch Wounds to be of the ſame rank with thoſe that only affect the <hi>Meninges,</hi> the Brain unhurt.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay, that not only a deep Wound of the Liver, but that part of it cut off has been cured. But ſuch Wounds run much Blood, and therefore the party dies, who is ſo wounded, before the Wound can be agglutinated. For they that ſay ſhallow Wounds of the Liver, and the edges of it cut may be healed, ſeem in the right. Therefore <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaies, Wounds of the Liver are mortal only in the <hi>Portae,</hi> and that People ſeldom eſcape when the thick part of the Liver is wounded. And it is moſt certainly true, that a Wound is mortal only in the Convex or Concave part of the Liver: For as to the Limb, or edge of that <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> (for a Man's Liver has no Lobes) a Wound there is only dangerous; and unleſs inflicted on a Cacochymick Body, or on one that commits ſome error, it may eaſily be cured.</p>

                        <hi>For the Stomach to be cut; Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſaies, <hi>it is mortal;</hi> thô <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies, ſome have made this Aphoriſm ambiguous: For ſome have been wounded in it, and rarely cured; yet if the Stomach be but ſlightly touched, it will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate. You may conſult <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Donatus,</hi> who relates, how ſeveral wounded in their Stomachs, have recovered. But <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> writes that a wound in the Stomach is mortal. But I encline to <hi>Galen</hi>'s opinion. And we muſt reckon accordingly in all theſe Wounds: For if only the outer coat be hurt, it eaſily heals; but if the Wound reach into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, the cure will prove difficult. Alſo a wound in the bottom has lefs danger: But in the mouth of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:52816:224"/>the Stomach (which is very ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous) any conſiderable Wound is deſperate upon ſeveral ſcores, <hi>viz.</hi> of the excellence of the part, its ſingular Sympathy with the Heart and Brain, and its exſanguous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Lungs, if they be large, if they make a deep ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity, if they waſte the fleſh of the part, and if they offend the great veſſels, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table branches of the <hi>Vena arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa</hi> and <hi>Arteria venoſd,</hi> muſt needs take life away, by the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of vital Spirits, and effuſion of Blood, and by the clotting of the Blood which impedes circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Wounds be ſmall or mean, but not treated artificially, the caſe is the ſame. When the great veſſels are not wounded, but only the <hi>Aſſera Arteria,</hi> or the <hi>Brenchia,</hi> ſuch wounds do not kill ſuddenly, but certainly: For ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes of death conſpire, the ſympathy of the Heart, diſſipation of the vital Spirits, putrefaction of the Lungs, difficulty of cure, continual motion, and the Cough ſtill enlarging the Wound. But if the leſs Blood-veſſels be broke, or the fleſh of the Lungs divided, the Wounds neither ſuddenly, nor of neceſſity kill a Man, unleſs the part be inflamed, thô more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lies in a Wound of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than of the veſſels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a firm <hi>Cicatrix</hi> cannot be made in it.

But if the Wound be in the fleſhy part, which goes round the inſide of the Breaſt, ſuch an one has, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies, been obſerved to heal up, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its motion: Thô he alwaies thought the cure diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, at whatever time an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation aroſe.</p>

And if the Wound reach into their Cavity, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaies, it is very ſeldom of the ſubſtance not only by reaſon of the ſubſtance of the Guts, but becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well apply a Medicament to inward as to outward Wounds. But above all, we find the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> moſt incurable, if it be wounded; becauſe of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the veſſels, the thinneſs of the coat, its nervous nature, vicinity of the Liver, and ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bile. Yet ſometimes a Wound has been cured, when it has only touched the outſide. But ſlight Wounds of the other Guts do heal up; becauſe they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carnous: And they ſeldom kill, unleſs an Inflammation, or an <hi>Ileus</hi> ſupervene: But great Wounds and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:52816:224"/>tranſverſe are mortal: becauſe there is a great ſeparation of parts, which are kept aſunder by the continual paſſing of vitious Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: and becauſe there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for application of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>

If indeed all its coat be divided, and cut through to the inſide, with a notable Wound, the caſe is mortal; But a ſmall Wound, experience has evinced; may heal up by the intervention of Fleſh, and that exactly. If the Wound be incurable, it muſt be received in the nervous part: So we ſee daily that Wounds in the neck of the Bladder, where it is fleſhy, made by cutting for the Stone, are cured. Yet it has been obſerved by ſome, that Wounds are ſeldom cured, if they be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that part, where the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is tied to the <hi>Os ſacrum.</hi>

                     <p>A Wound in the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is as mortal as in the Brain: for <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies, it is a kind of Brain to all the parts that are below the Head. It is ſuch therefore becauſe of the Nobility of the part, and of its nervous nature: Beſides, many and grievous Symptoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence: Its ſympathy with the Brain, and neighbouring parts is great: It is difficult to cure: And the Wound proves the more mortal, by how much the higher it is in the Spine. For, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies very truly, if the Spinal Marrow be totally hurt in any of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> all the lower parts are reſolved: But if only one ſide is hurt, and the other remain whole, the reſolution ſeizes only on thoſe lower parts, that are on the ſame ſide. This holds good as to the ſtructure of the Parts. But if you conſider the nature of the part, Wounds received in the lower part of the Spine are far worſe than in the upper, ſince the Marrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is almoſt nervous; but above, it is far ſofter and perfect Marrow. As the excellent Anatomiſt <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> has obſerved. But ſuch Wounds muſt be very great, to make them mortal: For one may be ſaved, when the weapon has not run deep in the Spinal Marrow. If the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be cut quite aſunder tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, it kills of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Wounds in the large Veins and Arteries, which are in the inſide of the Body, prove mortal, ſuch are the <hi>Vena cava, Magna arteria,</hi> the great Veins and Arteries about the Throat, in the Leg and Thigh, the great Veins in the Arm-pits, and Hams. Large Wounds in theſe muſt of neceſſity be mortal, by reaſon of immoderate effuſion of Blood. And the party dies the ſooner, by how much the leſs runs out of the Body; for then he is choaked. The nervous nature, and deep ſituation argue the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Cure, when no Medicine can arrive there in its full virtue, Little Veins cannot ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the vital Spirits when they are wounded.</p>
                     <p>Slight wounds of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> are ſometimes cured; great ones are altogether mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. And people dye of ſuch, not becauſe the breath contained in the Breaſt, goes out at the Wound, but becauſe being of a cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature, and in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:52816:225"/>it can never be healed. It is obſerved, that they are the moſt grievous, if about the upper part of the Throat, where divers Nerves, Veins and Arteries encreaſe the danger. For if the Artery be cut any where elſe, it has a good event. And when people are taken with a dangerous Quinzey, ſome very grave Phyſicians do ſucceſsfully preſcribe cutting of it.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Kidnies, becauſe many veſſels are diſſeminated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and they receive a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual afflux of Excrement, and have a neceſſary uſe for conſervation of life, are generally mortal.

                     <p>WE have, according to the beſt of our skill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in what parts Wounds are mortal: Now we muſt produce ſome tokens, which ſet theſe Wounds before our Eyes. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſuppoſe a Wound received in the Head or Breaſt, but no conſpicuous ſigns to ſhew, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Brain or Breaſt is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the cauſe of the parties death muſt be aſcribed to ſome other thing than the Wound. Therefore we muſt not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this in general, that marks of Parts diſaffected are wont to be deduced from the Hurt of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Site of the Parts, from the <hi>Excreta,</hi> from the property of the Grief, and from proper Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes. So, if after a Wound Reſpiration be hurt, a prudent Phyſician will ſay, that either the Lungs or Breaſt, or the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of it are hurt. But if Urine come out at the Wound, there is none but will acknowledge, either the Bladder or Ureters, or Kidneys
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:52816:225"/>muſt be wounded. If Excrements, the large Guts. If Chyle, the ſmall. As for the Site; if the Wound be received in the right <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> the Liver may juſtly be ſuſpected to be hurt; if in the <hi>Peclen,</hi> the Bladder: and ſo in other places the ſubject part may be ſuſpected. The property alſo of the pain will aſcertain you of the thing; for if the pain be dull, the fleſh of the Liver, or Spleen, or Lungs is hurt: if rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pungent, their veſſels and coats: but if violent, you may ſay the Stomach, Guts, and nervous parts are wounded. Regard alſo muſt equally be had to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Symptoms of each part: for a Phrenſie, Epilepſie, and ſuch accidents attend wounds of the Brain, Nauſcouſneſs, Vomit and Hickup, thoſe of the Stomach: Reſpiration hurt, thoſe of the Breaſt. But now to particulars.</p>
                     <p>When the Heart is wounded much Blood comes away: If it he the right Ventricle, the Blood runs black: If the Left, it runs more florid and light-coloured. The Arteries flag, the colour grows wan, Sweats cold and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and at length, when the parts grow cold, ſpeedy death enſues.</p>
                     <p>If the Brain or its Membranes be wounded, Blood comes out at the Noſe, and in ſome at the Ears; generally vomiting of Bile follows: Some have their Senſes ſtupefied: The Eyes turn ſtrangely in the Head: On the Third, or the Fifth day a <hi>Delirium</hi> follows; Many have a Convulſion of their Nerves: A peculiar violent Head-ach fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a hurt in the Membrane: which is enraged by ſhutting the Jaws, and holding ones Breath. The Eyes are hot, the Tongue ſalters; the Mind doats: but when the Brain is wounded, the Patient falls down; the Voice is loſt, the Face is drawn, there is vomiting of Bile, and a white Humor runs out of the Ears, like Pap.</p>
                     <p>When the Liver is wounded, much Blood comes out of the right Side; the Bowels are drawn to the Spine, there is a delight to lie on ones Belly, a pricking pain runs up to the Throat; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is vomiting of Bile, the Patient turns pale, coughs, and is in a Fever; Stool and Urine comes bloody; and the Body at laſt conſumes away.</p>
                     <p>If the Stomach be wounded, the Hickup and vomiting of Bile follows; the Meat and Drink is thrown up immediately; there are Swoonings; the Pulſe fails; ſmall Sweat runs off; the extream parts are cold; a moſt violent Pain; eſpecially if it tend upwards.</p>
                     <p>If the Lungs be wounded, there is difficulty of breathing; frothy Blood comes up at the Mouth; there is a noiſe in breathing; the Party likes to lie on the Wound and then he ſpeaks; if he lie on another part he is dumb. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, if the Wound be wide, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Blood comes out at it; if not wide, it comes up at the Mouth; the veſſels of the Neck are raiſed; the Tongue is of a ſtrange colour, they draw in much breath; they crave cold things; and if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, a Fever and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption kill the Man.</p>
                     <p>When the Midriff is wounded, the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are drawn upwards,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:52816:226"/>the Spine akes, they breath ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is large, with ſighing, and pain all over the Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>When the Guts are wounded Meat and Drink come out at the Wound, the <hi>Praecordia</hi> ſwell; Sometimes Choler makes a way at the Mouth: If the lower Guts are wounded, the Excrements and Smell ſhew it.</p>
                     <p>When the Bladder is wounded, the Groins do ake, they ſwell above the <hi>Os Pubis;</hi> Blood comes away with the Urine, and Urine runs out at the Wound, the Stomach is diſaffected; therefore they either vomit Bile, or have the Hickup; they are cold, and then dry.</p>
                     <p>If the Spinal Marrow be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Nerves are paralytick, or convulſe; Senſe is loſt; at times the lower parts void either Seed, or Urine, or Ordure.</p>
                     <p>If the Veins or Arteries, which are deep in the Body be wounded, the Veins pour out abundance of black Blood, the Parties wax pale, and their death is ſudden? The Arteries pour out thin, yellow, and frothy Blood, the Pulſe alters, and Death quickly enſues.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> is wounded, it bleeds but little; there is great pain backwards; the Throat is by little and little filled with Blood; the Voice is hoarſe, and the Tongue is dry.</p>
                     <p>When the Kidneys are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Pain reaches to the Groin and Teſticles; there is difficulty in making water, and it is bloody, or all Blood.</p>
                     <p>When the Spleen is wounded, black Blood proceeds from the left Side; the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach grow hard on that ſide; Thirſt is violent, and there is Pain in the Throat, as when the Liver is wounded.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are moſt of the Signs, whereby you may eaſily find, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parts of the Body, whoſe wounds we have declared mortal, be wounded. If none of theſe ſigns appear, you may conclude none of theſe Parts are touched; and you muſt ſeek for the cauſe of the Diſeaſe ſomewhere elſe.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What Wounds may be called ſafe, and what dangerous.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE ſaid that thoſe Wounds were ſafe, which are in their own nature without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in general they are ſuch, as are received far from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parts: Of which kind <hi>Celſus</hi> makes thoſe to be that only wound the fleſh; but in the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Judgment theſe ſame are ſometimes worſe, ſometimes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For whatever Wound is large, creates danger; and that is worſt, which is beaten againſt a thing, or out of which ſomething is cut; or when the fleſh is part cut away, and part hanging on; a Wound is worſt that is round; the ſafeſt, that is in a right line. Beſides, a Child is ſooner healed than a Youth or elder Perſon: a ſtrong Man than an infirm; one of a middle habit, than one very groſs or very ſpare; one of a ſound habit, than corrupt; one of much exerciſe, than an idle perſon: a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and temperate Man, than one given to Wine and Women. The moſt ſeaſonable time for cure is the Spring, or ſuch as is neither hot nor cold; therefore <hi>Autumn</hi> is moſt pernicious. And theſe are the things that render Wounds, which are in themſelves ſafe, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Thô in reality they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change their Nature. For if only a fleſhy part be wounded, the Wound is in its own Nature ſafe; and if any danger ariſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is in the blame. Wounds of a middle Nature, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Guido,</hi> are ſuch as are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the heads of the Muſcles, in the Scull, in the Breaſt and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, That all wounds of the Nerves and nervous parts are not indeed mortal, but only dangerous. In another place he ſays, they are dangerous, that have an equal tendency to death and life: and he calls them doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It has been obſerved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny skilful Men, that Wounds under the Clavicle, and the inner proceſs of the <hi>Scapula</hi> are formidable, and full of danger: for beſide the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilick Vein and Axillar Artery, there is the fifth pair of Nerves, which run from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck to the Arms. Of this kind are many of thoſe Wounds, which <hi>Celſus</hi> writes, difficult of cure, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Arm-pits and Hams; about the <hi>Anus</hi> and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; in the Thighs and among the Fingers: and any Wound that has hurt the head, or end of a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:52816:227"/>Muſcle, a Nerve, Artery, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, Bone, or Cartilage, In this reſpect wounds in the Neck are dangerous; for often it ſo falls out, that ſome remarkable Nerve or Tendon is thereby hurt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the wound reach to the Spinal Marrow. It has been alſo obſerved, that wounds which are near the Navil (for thereabout lie the perforated Tendons of the oblique and tranſverſe Muſcles) are not without danger; thô they reach not deep. And ſuch as are received in the back part of the Breaſt: for thô they reach not the Cavity; yet becauſe thereabout no ſmall Veins and Arteries, and many Nerves are diſperſed, they are dangerous. Whenever Joints are wounded, they import danger, by reaſon of the Tendons and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments that are found there, for wounds in theſe parts uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce malignant Symptoms, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the inſide of the Arm be wounded. Of this nature are the Arm-pits, the bending of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, the inſide of the Wriſt; and the outſide of the Leg: for in theſe parts there are great Veins, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies, Nerves and Tendons, which uſually occaſion Bleeding, violent Pain, and ſeveral other miſchiefs. But if nervous parts are wounded (becauſe this requires a skilful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and no ſmall diligence in a Chirurgeon) you may eaſily know it in this manner. When a Nerve is either prickt or cut, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes Senſe is loſt, or at leaſt hurt; and there is a nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eſs in the parts under the wound; Pain is violent; the part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> inflamed; and by conſent with the Brain a <hi>Delirium</hi> often ariſes: A Convulſion often follows; and that oftner when the part is prickt, or partly cut, than when it is quite cut aſunder. The ſame ſigns, but more obſcure, happen in wounds of the Tendons and Membranes, which inveſt the Scull and the reſt of the Bones, eſpecially when the Ligaments of the Joints are cut. We ſaid alſo, that many of thoſe wounds, that are for the moſtpart mortal, may be reckon'd among theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they are ſmall. If therefore the Lungs in any part, the thick of the Liver, the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> Spleen, or Womb be but ſlightly wounded, they are in this rank. And whereas I ſay, Wounds of the Nerves are not mortal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Men doubt of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall maintain it by Reaſon. In the firſt place we muſt take notice of this from <hi>Galen,</hi> that under the name of Nerves, both the Nerves themſelves ariſing from the Brain and ſpinal Marrow, and the Ligaments and Tendous are comprehended, of all which he calls the Wounds malignant and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, never mortal: And thoſe that are ſo wounded, are ſo far from dying for the moſt part; that they oftner recover.
<q>For (ſays he) not one died of a wound of the Nerves: wherefore he that joyns experimental Anatomy, and the uſe of Medicaments, he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as we do, cure wounds of the Nerves without any danger; ſo that no principal part may be drawn into conſent; nor the wounded, or contuſed Nerve la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of an Inflammation; or if they ſhould come, much leſs ſhall either Putrefaction, or Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Convulſion, or Death
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:52816:227"/>enſue.</q> Beſides it has been proved before, that mortal Wounds can be inflicted only on thoſe parts, that are either principal, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a neceſſary uſe to the Animal, or ſuch as are endued with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, or deſtroy ſtrength by large bleeding. Now conſider every particular, and you will find the Nerves none of them: For they are not of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, unleſs where there is a concourſe of many ſenſitive Nerves. You ſee an Hand, an Arm, a Leg and their Nerves cut off without loſs of Life; therefore without doubt Wounds of the Nerves ſhould not be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mortal ones; but only among the dangerous. This alſo is to be obſerved, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſmalneſs of the Wound makes no ſmall difference. For Nerves, which have their Original from the Brain immediately, or mediately from the interpoſition of the Spinal Marrow, are more apt to cauſe Convulſion, than Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, which are made up of a Nerve and a Ligament: But a wounded Ligament, if it be one that proceeds from one Bone to another is not ſo dangerous; but if it inſert it ſelf into a Muſcle, the more of Nerve there is in it, except it be very carefully lookt after, the more danger there is in it, than in other Ligaments. Thô, I confeſs ſome people may be met with, who have ſuch exquiſitely ſenſible Nerves, that upon a ſlight Wound, eſpecially in the top of the Spine, they not only die, but that ſuddenly.</p>

                        <p>Of what nature Wounds of the Head may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Queſtion may ariſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wounds of the Head, that are only in the cutane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part, or make bare, or break the Bone, but do not hurt the <hi>Menynges,</hi> what ſuch they are, whether they be altogether ſafe, and without danger, or dangerous and of a middle nature? For it is an Argument they are ſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inflicted in a carnous part, or in the very Skin, no Principal, or Nervous, or any ſuch Part being offended: But it is an Argument they are dangerous, becauſe near the Brain, and they put a Man in more hazard, than any other parts, when wounded. For my own part, I am of opinion, that Wounds of the Head have I know
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:52816:228"/>not what peculiar to them, and different from divers others, ſo that one muſt have a great care, how he gives his judgment in them. For they produce many and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms, the like whereof ſeldom occurs in others; ſo that the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> might very well leave us a whole Book <hi>of Wounds of the Head.</hi> And there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which admitting a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in others, do ſhew, that theſe Wounds are worſe and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than others; namely, the nature of the Part, aptneſs to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and difficulty of Cure. For the Skin (to ſpeak of that firſt) which is very thick, moiſt and rare, is expoſed very much to the injuries of the external Air: For ſince the the ambient Air is in its own nature always moiſter and colder than the Skin of the Head and the Bone underneath; no wonder, while it is whiffling up and down the Wound, if it be able to convert the natural tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the part to immoderate moiſture: Which is more readily done, if the wounded party live in moiſt and therefore unhealthy places; eſpecially if the Skull be laid bare or opened, ſo as that the <hi>Menynx</hi> appears. Beſides the Skin of the Head has a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and receives Nerves from the firſt and ſecond <hi>Veriebrae</hi> of the Neck, and from the third Conjugation of the Brain, which are diſſeminated all through its ſubſtance: for which reaſon <hi>Paraeus</hi> thinks, that Wounds, Contuſions and Apoſtems of this Skin ſhould be treated with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. And the conſtruction of the Head is ſuch, that whatever Diſeaſe is contracted in the Skin, it may eaſily by a breach in the Skull, or by the next Sutures be communicated to the <hi>Menynges,</hi> and the Brain it ſelf. Beſides, its conſtitution is ſuch, that, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> writes, the Bone may be cleſt in another part, than where it is ſtruck, which they call <hi>Reſonitus cranii,</hi> or Contrafiſſure. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Avicenna</hi> profeſſes, that the Skull is often broken, the Skin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining whole: And <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, that the Bone is perfectly whole, yet by the blow ſome Vein in the Membrane of the Brain is broke, which bleeds. In theſe Caſes the moſt diligent Phyſician is at a ſtand what to do. And Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons oftentimes are more then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſtaken in curing ſuch Wounds, unleſs they be both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and well experienced. For it is uſual with them, while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to alter the coldneſs of the Ambient Air, not only to ſtifle the room with woollen Curtains, but in the middle of Summer to kindle a fire in it, and omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may cauſe heat, which may eaſily occaſion a Fever and Inflammation. Nor do they know that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> when he had commended a hot Seaſon for other Sores, yet for thoſe in the Head he commends the time of <hi>Aequinox.</hi> Then they often raſhly dilate the Wound with many Sections; cut the Veins, Arteries and Branches of the Nerves with Inſtruments and their Nails, and tear the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium;</hi> which is of great uſe. This is a certain Nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane ariſing from certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments ſprung from the very <hi>Menynx,</hi> and ſome thin Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:52816:228"/>which come out at the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and join the <hi>Dura Menynx</hi> with the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Miſtakes alſo are often made about the Sutures; while they miſtake the dents that are made by the Weapon for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sutures, and open them not, which is a work abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Thô in this fault they have <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the caſe of <hi>Autonomus</hi> 5. <hi>Epidem.</hi> which makes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake leſs diſhonourable. They are much more to be blamed, who miſtaking the Sutures for Dents left by a Weapon, raſhly trepan; and ſo endanger the Patient. And there are other miſtakes, common to other Wounds, which are of more danger in theſe. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in curing makes theſe Wounds alſo more dangerous: For, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, you cannot adapt that Ligature to the Head, which reaſon has invented to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Inflammation, eſpecially in other parts: Therefore you can neither repreſs the affluent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor expreſs what is contained in the ſick parts. Beſides, ſince the Bone of the Skull is very dry, and adjoining parts moiſt, it is a difficult thing equally to preſerve the natural temperature of them all. Which has cauſed a difficult controverſie among Phyſicians, whether driers or midling Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are proper in the cure of the Head? From all which things <hi>Hippocrates</hi> might very well deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that no Wound of the Head ſhould be ſlighted: for only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion of the Skin, unleſs it be carefully handled, may cauſe a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and create the Phyſician much trouble, and the Patient much danger. I conclude therefore, that Wounds of the Head are no ways ſafe, but altogether dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; eſpecially ſuch as reach to the Bone, and lay open the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynx.</hi> For they have place among Nervous Wounds, which I have ſaid are dangerous. Yet I adviſe you, in giving of your Judgment, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to obſerve the natures of Climes and Places, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. For in a City low ſituated, and where many uſe to die of ſuch Wounds, you muſt pronounce them dangerous altogether: But in a City high ſituated, and in a wholeſome Air, you may ſay they are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but not ſo very dangerous.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How it may be determined, whether a Man died of his Wound, or of ſome other cauſe?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THings being in this manner ſtated, it will be no great difficulty to deprehend, what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the beginning, <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether a man died of his Wound, or ſomething elſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his death? For if the Wound, under debate, be known to be mortal (whether of neceſſity, or for the moſt part it be ſuch) without doubt the blame is to be laid on the Wound. If it be ſafe and without danger, the Man's death muſt be imputed to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. But if Wounds be of the dangerous and middle ſort; as they are of a doubtful nature, our judgment concerning them ſhould be ſuch: For if they be great, they themſelves occaſion death; if little, it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to ſomething elſe. Thus therefore, if a great Wound be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Joint, which has cut or torn the Tendons, Nerves and Veſſels, althô of it ſelf it be not mortal; yet becauſe it is full of danger, and admits of no errors without harm, and requires a moſt exact cure, to be managed with all care and diligence, which Phyſicians are not every where, thô they do their duty, able to perform (for <hi>never to miſtake</hi> is above Humane Capacity) nor can the Sick every where obſerve an exquiſitely-regular Diet. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Party die, you will not do amiſs, if you report the Wound to have been the cauſe of his death; unleſs ſome egregious error has been committed in the cure, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chirurgeon, or Patient, or any thing elſe occaſioned it. Then indeed the Aggreſſor is much excuſed: for tho without that error the wounded party might have died; yet becauſe the caſe is dubious, and where any doubt is, the conjecture ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in favour of the Criminal, whatever the error were, it muſt be ſaid to have cauſed the parties death. Concerning Wounds of the Head, which have ſomething peculiar in them, as we have ſhown before, you muſt make report in this manner. Firſt, conſider with your ſelf, how the Air and Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity of the place ſtand affected toward Wounds of the Head; and if you find, that in all Seaſons people die of theſe Wounds, all Wounds, where there is occaſion
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:52816:229"/>to open the Skull, muſt be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the very dangerous; and ſuch, unleſs ſome egregious and plain error have been committed, muſt be concluded to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned death. Other Wounds, thô they be dangerous, draw nearer to the nature of ſafe ones. But when the Salubrity of the Clime abates the danger of theſe Wounds, then all Wounds of the Head, ſo that the Membranes be not affected, even if the Bone be broke and perforated, muſt by no means be ranked among the very dangerous: Except much of the Skull be taken away: For then, becauſe it is impoſſible for the Membrane not to be hurt, you muſt account ſuch Wounds dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Hence therefore it may be determined, which I find to be the Opinion of grave Lawyers, <hi>(T. in. l. ſi ex plaga, ff. ad leg. Aquil.)</hi> if a Servant not mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed die (by mortally, I mean very dangerouſly, as in great Wounds of the Joints) the Caſe will be an action of Battery not Murther. Wherefore <hi>Guido,</hi> an ancient and learned Phyſician thinks their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vain, that ſay, a Man would never die, thô he offend in the courſe of his living, unleſs he had received a Wound: So that they ſeem to lay ones Death to the Wound, thô never ſo ſafe, and without danger. But I ſhall confute their error by and by.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw I undertake to declare, how wounded Perſons die, not ſo much of their Wounds, as of ſome other cauſe, which is a thing that falls moſt under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. I find ſix cauſes of this unhappy event. The firſt is, when the wounded Party is of a Cacochymick Body. The ſecond, when the wounded Part is ſome way weak and infirm. The third, when Men offend in their way of Living. The fourth, a bad conſtitution of the Air. The fifth, the Chirurgeon's negligence. The ſixth, ſome uncertain Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which cannot be reduced to Method. I ſhall demonſtrate all particularly. As to the firſt; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Wound be inflicted on a Body full of bad Humors, ſuch as are the Cachectick, People trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Leproſie, the Pox, Dropſie, Conſumption, and ſuch
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:52816:230"/>like; and that not in a principal Part neither, but in a carnous, and one not liable to danger: No Man is ignorant, what ſharp Pain, great Inflammations, Fevers, Convulſions, and other bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms do thence ariſe, the Humors flowing in every way into the wounded Part. Nor can any Man doubt of the ſecond: For if a Man, for inſtance, get but a little Wound in a Joint, which had not long before been troubled with a Defluxion: or if a Part once wounded, be offended in the ſame manner again: or if there be ſome peculiar diſpoſition and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body, which naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man to ſome certain ſort of Diſeaſe; is not a ſmall Cut able to put ſuch a Man into great danger of his Life? And errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Diet, what do they not pervert and deprave, if after a Wound received, a Man cram him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and drink Wine; if he addict himſelf unſeaſonably to Venery; if he perplex his Mind with Cares, and his Body with unſeaſonable Exerciſe? But how frequently is there a ſickly conſtitution of the Seaſon abroad, which may irritate and exaſperate even a ſmall Wound, whether manifeſt intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, or the aſpect of ſome unhappy Star occaſion it? For from thence, even upon a ſlight occaſion, Inflammations, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevers, and other formidable Symptoms are deduced. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this has happened even in my time; and ſeveral Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſeen it. Therefore <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> does well adviſe us, to conſider in Diſeaſes the ſtrength of Epidemick Diſeaſes; and to know the condition of the Seaſon. Perhaps <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned this among the latent occaſions; for when he had ſaid, that an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happens in Wounds from the ſtrength of Liniments, from Cold, much Eating; or from drinking of Wine, he then ſubjoins, or from ſome other latent occaſion; which I think may not be underſtood amiſs of a certain conſtitution of the Heaven, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called <hi>Divine.</hi> I need not ſay much of the Chirurgeon's igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or negligence, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condole the calamity of the Age, wherein a ſort of unlearned Men, and ignorant Barbers are called to cure Wounds, who the leſs they know of Learning, the abler Practitioners they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, impudently vaunting that Learning is a hinderance to their Buſineſs. The laſt Reaſon, that often exaſperates a ſlight hurt, depends on fortuitous Accidents; as if the Weapon which gave the Wound were ruſty; if the Lint, which was uſed to the Wound were infected with any bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if any hurtful thing fell into the Wound; if bad Medicaments be applied; and ſeveral other things which I know very well put a Wound into a bad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And theſe are the Cauſes, why a ſmall Cut may much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger a Man. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does not obſcurely intimate this, when he ſays, that <hi>Men die of all ſorts of Wounds: for many Wounds are ſeen in ignoble, and no bad places, which yet cauſe death, and no wonder; for the Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men do much differ, and are of great force.</hi> But becauſe
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:52816:230"/>theſe are Generals, I ſhall inſtance in ſome particulars of ſuch as have died of ſlight blows. 5. <hi>Epidem. circa finem, Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that <hi>Philes</hi> ſon upon a ſmall denudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Os Frontis,</hi> a Fever ariſing the ninth day, died. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a fair Maiden, the Daughter of <hi>Nereus,</hi> being ſtruck with a flat hand on the Forehead by a Woman, her familiar, as they were a play, died the ninth day. Alſo the Maſter of a great Ship, having broke a Finger with the Anchor, died of it. A Boy, the Son of <hi>Metrophantus,</hi> being ſtruck by another Boy with an Earthen Pot on the Head, died, becauſe he ſcratched the edges of the Sore. And ſome of the moſt learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> do hold, that all theſe died, either through the miſtake of the Chirurgeon, or becauſe of a bad habit of Body, or by reaſon of an unwholeſome Seaſon.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THat nothing may be wanting about this Affair, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove you to obſerve ſome term of days within which ſome latent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief from a Wound, if it have lain lurking a few days, muſt ſhew it ſelf. If Mortal Signs do long poſtpone; you cannot then of right blame the Wound; but ſomething elſe. <hi>Guido,</hi> a man of great experience, in his general Speculation of Wounds ſets three terms, wherein Mortal Signs ſhow themſelves; the Seventh, Ninth and Fortieth. <hi>Tagaultius</hi> in this, as in all things elſe, follows him; only inſtead of the ninth day he puts the fourteenth. Some of the moſt skilful among the Moderns for the firſt days of the Wound ſuſpend their Judgments; nor do they give their opinion of the quality of the Wound before the ninth day is over: for they ſay, within that time gentle or horrid Symptoms uſually ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wound, the party hurt, and the ambient Air. Nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon: for the ninth day, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifies, is judicatory of Diſeaſes; and he ſays, that <hi>Achilles</hi> knew, the Peſtilence in the Army had no vulgar cauſe, becauſe it exceeded the ninth day. But thô I deny not theſe things to be true; yet they create not Science. Therefore the beſt way is to pitch
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:52816:231"/>upon ſome Method at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whereby a Chirurgeon may make perpetually a pretty ſure conjecture concerning Wounds. <hi>Hippocrates, lib. de vulner. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> affirms, if a man have broke his Skull, and commit an error, if it be neither raſpt nor perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, a Fever ſeizes him before the fourteenth day in Winter; but about the ſeventh in Summer; and if all things perſevere bad, in Summer he will die before the ſeventh, and in Winter before the fourteenth day. From which paſſage, I think, I ſhall be able to gather the true way of judging: For he ſays, that bad Symptoms begin and death happens later in Winter and ſooner in Summer. And as this is moſt certainly true, I am able to give no other reaſon for it, than that in Winter our heat is more vivacious and ſtrong; and therefore reſiſts nocent cauſes the more; for the Ventricles are by nature hotteſt in Winter. On the contrary, ſince our ſtrength is eaſily ſpent by the ambient heat, it ſo happens, that then we are moſt liable to morbid injuries. For the ſame reaſon, if things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwiſe than well, I ſay, that mortal Symptoms are longer in appearing in a ſtrong Patient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>han in a weak one: for as ſtrength retards the approach of death, ſo does it of grievous Symptoms. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore as by Age, Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sex and Time of the year the Strength is firmer, the longer will the Symptoms and Death be in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. So if a young Man of a good conſtitution, and in perfect health receive a Wound in Winter, whoſe event may prove hazardous, I would wait for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Symptoms on the fourteenth day before I would give my judgment; which if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, I would predict death, on the next critical day, or on ſome other, according as the malady proceeded flower or ſharper. On the contrary, if an old Woman be wounded, who is of a cold and dry complexion, and of a bad habit of Body; I gueſs the Symptoms in reference to the Wound would ariſe about the ſeventh day. And thô <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that in ſome Diſeaſes, young people die ſooner than old, it holds true indeed in ſpontaneous and violent Diſeaſes: for old people generally die more of the tediouſneſs of a Diſeaſe, and of a relapſe, than of the violence of it. But in Wounds it is as we ſaid before. And that you may not be raſh in your judgment, we have given you both the nature and times of Wounds.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THat many die ſuddenly of beating and Contuſions, is ſo evident by ſeveral ſuch ſad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, that I need ſay no more of that: But if the manner of ones death be unknown, it is not yet agreed by what way and means it may be found out. The vulgar Opinion is, that Wheals, and black and blew Spots (theſe marks are made, when the little Veins, that are diſſeminated under the Skin, being broken and cut, do pour out Blood, which afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of its natural Veſſels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a livid colour) are the only evidence of blows received. But I think, they are much out: for every bruiſed part does not always appear black and blew, unleſs it be endued with Veins, and thoſe not lying deep. If a bruiſe happen (as <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſays) in Nervous places; or in any other but Fleſhy, you ſhall neither find redneſs, nor any <hi>Ecchymoſis.</hi> Beſides, you may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten find blackneſs and blewneſs in the Body of ſuch as died of Poiſon, and of internal and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Diſeaſes. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Acutor. Regimine,</hi> ſays, in Pleuriticks, who die of taking Ptiſan unſeaſonably, their ſide looks livid, like a bruiſe. And 4. <hi>Epidem.</hi> he ſays, one that died of a Dropſie, had his <hi>Hypochondria</hi> look red, as if his Body had been beaten with ſtripes. And 5. <hi>Epid.

Now the cauſe of this Symptom (for I think it is worth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſeems to me to be the effort of Nature; which ſhe violently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts in Extremity. For ſhe thruſts the Blood thither, which being deſtitute of vivid Spirits turns livid. <hi>Paraeus</hi> alſo has obſerved, that in ſome, after death, ſpots (called <hi>Peticulae</hi>) appear before the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are cold, which are ſigns of Putrefaction. Therefore ſpots are no certain evidences of blows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. There are ſome alſo who think voiding of Blood is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſign of ſuch a death. But they are out: for I have ſeen ſome, that died of an internal cauſe, who ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly bled, as they were about to be buried.

                        <p>What are the chief Signs of ſuch, as being beaten died, but of no conſpicuous Wound.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw therefore we declare our Opinion of the Matter. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicenna</hi> ſays, a Fall and hitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a thing (hither you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Blows and Bruiſes) hurt Mens Bodies two ways, and cauſe death, namely, either becauſe they tear the Bowels, the Coats, Nerves and great Veſſels, or becauſe they occaſion Pain; to which I add a third, which is proper to a blow on the Head, becauſe it produces moſt grievous Symptoms in the Head, an Apoplexy, <hi>Catochus,</hi> and the like, occaſioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion and compreſſion of the Brain, and interception of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. Things therefore ſtanding thus, my opinion is, when a violent blow upon a part, under which ſome great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel lies; as the <hi>Epigaſtrium,</hi> in which great Veins and Arteries are contained, that Blood will be voided by Excretion out of the Breaſt, or by the urinary Paſſages. But if it ſo happen that the Mouth of the Stomach receives a blow, becauſe a hurt in that part uſes to kill Men with the pain; it is not neceſſary that Blood come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; nor likewiſe muſt you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a Sign in every blow on the Head. For the Head may be ſo weak, that the ſlighteſt blow may endanger one. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Head had he, that died of a box on the Ear Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectick, and the Maid in <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> mentioned before, who died of a flat blow given her in jeſt by a Woman upon the Forehead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with a <hi>Vertigo</hi> and want of breathing. But it is otherwiſe, when one receives a violent blow on the Head; I grant Blood may come out at the Ears and Noſe. Wherefore I think it is evident from what has been ſaid, that they who die of a blow, do generally void blood; but this is not always neceſſary; for a blow on the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or on the Forehead, which according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is the weakeſt part in the Head, and has moſt danger in it, and on the Temples, which are alſo weak, does not always bleed. Nor muſt we conclude there has been a blow, if blood do come; for I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved it in ſuch as have died of internal Diſeaſes, eſpecially of malignant Fevers. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Signs of a Mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten can neither be had
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:52816:232"/>from ſpots nor bleeding, we can determine nothing for certain. Thô when theſe two Signs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and there was no other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt occaſion of death, then there is ſuſpicion of a blow.</p>

                     <p>YOu geneerally find drowned People thrown upon the Shore, or lying in Wellsand ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters. But if the ſubtilty of Man ſhould endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all ſuſpicion of the Crime; yet an unuſual ſwelling and flabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole Body cannot be hid; the Belly alſo will ſwell; ſome mucous Excrements will
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:52816:233"/>come out at the Noſe, and froa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtuff out at the Mouth; the Fingers ends are worn: for they that are drowned, endeavour to get out, and ſcrabble in the Sand, and ſo wear their Fingers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I ſay, that drowned Bodies are ſwollen; it is not ſo much by ſucking in the Water, or by any Water contained therein, as by a Vapor, into which the Humors are turned by a putrid heat, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſwelling ſhows not it ſelf, till after ſome time. There is another Suffocation, in ſome places more frequent, which is acted by ſhutting the Noſe and Mouth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, or by a ſtrait cord. And that you may have no trick put upon you in this, take it as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maxim, that it is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom common to all who have the uſe of Inſpiration ſtopt, for them to froath at the Mouth: for the expiration of fuliginous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being intercepted by a Cord, or otherwiſe, they are all violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impelled; whence it comes to paſs, that part of the proper hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity is expelled together with them, as you obſerve in letting Blood. But if one be ſtrangled with a Rope, the print of it will appear either black or red, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the Rope croſſes. The Head of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> is often bruiſed, and there is a luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Cervix;</hi> the Arms, Legs and Face are livid; the Breaſt is ſwollen, and the Urine is volded. Of all which things this Reaſon may be given. The ſwelling of the Breaſt is cauſed by much Vapor raiſed by containing the Breath within; the paſſage of the Urine by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal ſtraining of the Muſcles, which conſpiring for the common ſafety are contracted towards their Original; and therefore make way for its paſſage. Alſo the Face is not pale, but of a violet or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour. But if you have a mind to ſearch more narrowly, you will find the diffected Lungs full of purulent froath, and all the other <hi>Viſcera</hi> in good order. And Anatomiſts in opening ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do find the Head and Breaſt full of Blood. But if the Breath has been ſtopt any other way, you will find the ſame ſigns, except the print of the Rope. In theſe alſo you may obſerve ſpots ariſe in divers places. For the force of ſtrangling is ſuch, that the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty of all the parts of the Body is irritated, and therefore it forces all the Blood and other Juices to the Skin; and eſpecially to thoſe places, that have larger and more capacious Veſſels, as the Back, Face, and ſuch parts.</p>

But, ſays he, as there is a familiar quality of a liniment in Pulſe, Pot-herbs, Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a foreign one in <hi>Cantharides,</hi> the Sea-Hare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> might as well have ſaid, that in ſome Air there is a quality fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to our nature; in another there is one forein, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Now here <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems of the opinion, that People dye by drawing in an Air of an inimicous and forein quality to us. But in another place where he treats more exactly of the thing; They ſays he, that tarry too long in the Bath, faint, and at laſt dye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural heat cannot be maintained: Now it is maintained by Ventilation of its principle the innate heat, by a moderate refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration, and departure of that which is fumous, for People in Baths dye, not becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are evacuated out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but becauſe of the heat. And the reaſon why People dye in ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caves, in Houſes new plaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the ſteam of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, is, becauſe the cold Air is not attracted, which is abſolutely neceſſary for Reſpiration. But if you demand what kind of death ſuch People dye. Some famous Phyſicians think that all of them dye Apoplectick, and that the Brain is affected in its Ventricles, they being filled with a foetid and groſs vapour, vellicating them by a malignant quality: for they ſay, the Animal is deprived of Senſe and Motion, and froaths at the Mouth. Yet to me <hi>Galen</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems truer, who holds, that all who dye in ſtinking Caves, and Pits, and ſuch like places, dye not of any fault in their Brain;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:52816:234"/>but for want of cool Air, whereby the innate heat is ventilated and cooled. For whereas ſome ſay, that in ſuffocations the Brain ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, becauſe the animal Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be fed by the vital; <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> denies it, and ſhews, that to feed the animal Spirit, there is no great need of that Spirit which is ſent from the Heart: but it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that there be an evaporation from the Blood; or which is of more moment, that there be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration at the Noſe. And ſince there are two things, which we attract by Reſpiration, namely, the ſubſtance and quality of the Air, and when hot Air is inſpired, enough of the ſubſtance indeed is attracted; nevertheleſs the Animal is ſuffocated, as thô it inſpired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; therefore it remains, that a cool quality in the Air is chiefly requiſite to Reſpiration; for want of which, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat cannot be cooled and ventilated, when it is beyond meaſure heated, it kills the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; And <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that froth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Symptom common to all them, that have the uſe of Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration intercepted. But as for the ſigns, which is the thing we here enquire after, I can find none, which all ſuffocated People have, but that of frothing: only ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Breaſt, and profuſion of Urine do not appear in this laſt ſort: for they dye of a leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, than they that are ſtrangled with a cord; or they whoſe Mouth and Noſe are ſtopt, And thus much of ſuffocated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                        </q> So <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> whoſe Opinion, thô it be not unknown to the more skilful; yet becauſe there are ſome who do not ſo well underſtand his ſuccinct way of writing, I ſhall periphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically illuſtrate the Author's Senſe, about the kinds and differences of Thunder. There are therefore three kinds of Thunder (for it is found to do hurt three manner of ways) The Firſt is, that which terebrates, and makes as it were a hole in a body. The Second is that which diſcuſſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> diſſipates and ſevers the Body into divers parts. And the Third, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burns. As for the Firſt, whoſe property we ſaid it was to tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, it is ſubtil, and collected into it ſelf, and not at all expanſe. The Second, which diſſipates, has compact and conglobated Spirits, it does its violence unequally, and like a ſtorm tears and breaks all. The Third, whoſe property it is to burn, has a terrene ſubſtance, and is liker to fiery matter than to flame, and therefore leaves evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigns of burning. For thô other Thunders burn; yet we call this burning, becauſe it ſhews more ſigns of Fire and burning than the reſt. This is twofold, one chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burns, the other makes the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy black. That which burns is threefold, ſome burns ſlightly, and only blaſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> as if a breath touched a body, and does little harm. The Second burns and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes. The Third kindles, and ſets on fire. It is common for all Thunder to burn, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, either changing the natural colour a little, or wholly changing the colour, into blew, pale, black, or ſome other colour.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw therefore that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Seneca;</hi> and that it appears, Mens Bodies are many ways affected by Thunder; yet two things are common to all (which to know is much to our purpoſe) namely, to contract a brown colour, where the Thunder ſtrikes, and to be ſomewhere burnt, Beſides, it ſmells like Sulphur, for, as the Learned <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves, the flaſh of Lightning is ſulphureous. Alſo they that are ſtruck, lye on the contrary ſide; and, as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves, their Head lies from the Thunder. He that is awake, keeps his Eies ſhut, and he that is aſleep, keeps them open. Bodies alſo ſtruck with Thunder, as ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentators have obſerved, are colder where they are ſtruck, than any where elſe in their Body. Some have written, that Bodies ſtruck with Thunder, grow drie; but never corrupt. Therefore that Poet might very well be blamed, who fang, How Thunder-ſtruck <hi>Phaëthon</hi> putrefied in ſome Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. But I know not whether <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> would grant this, who, <hi>l. de naturalib.</hi> affirms. That People ſtruck with Thunder breed Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots in a few days. Therefore, if you well obſerve what has been ſaid, it will be no difficulty to find out, when People are ſlain by Thunder. But whereas ſome think, that Thunder muſt always batter, and that they who fall ſo, are always found with their Limbs broken, they are much miſtaken. For, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of Thunder, every ſort of it is Spirit, which is either thin and clear, and therefore not burning; or thick and fumid, and ſuch conſumes by burning. And upon this place where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that all Thunder is Spirit, and of ſuch, <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> adds, and not a Stone, or Bolt, or any thing ſolid, as ſome are of opinion. And whereas Iron, and the moſt ſolid of things is often broken and diſſipated by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that is not done by any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid matter; but becauſe the nature and violence of Thunder is ſuch, that it only hurts things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and put a check to it; and like a magnanimous Warriour, either it ſlightly touches, or quite neglects things that give way. Therefore, becauſe Man is all over covered with a fleſhy ſoftneſs, you ſhall rarely find him bruiſed; but always burnt or blaſted. For this reaſon <hi>Seneca</hi> might well be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:52816:235"/>that there was a peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial power in Thunder: becauſe People do not only fall by the blow, but likewiſe by blaſting. It is alſo obſerved, that Bodies ſlain by Thunder, are for the moſt part light; becauſe the moiſture by that great burning from Heaven is dried up. And this ſhall ſuffice for the ſigns of People being killed with Thunder.</p>

                        <p>How a Chirurgeon may be able to predict ſome hurts of the Functions in ſome wounded Parts? Firſt, what is the Inſtrument of voluntary Motion?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT ſometimes ſo happens, that upon a Wound given, before the event be ſeen, our Judgment is demanded in Court, whether it will lame a Man, or make any part imperfect in its Functions? To which Queſtions it is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is able to give a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Anſwer: He had need be a skilful Artiſt, who knows exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtructure of the parts of the Body, and their uſe, and who has carefully obſerved the various e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Wounds. This Treatiſe alſo may be of uſe, thô you be far from any Court: For when, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art, you predict the events of great Wounds, you will leave no room for reprehenſion to thoſe querulous people, that would lay the blame of the aboliſhed Function upon the Phyſicians cure, not upon the Wound received. The knowledge of this thing is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very neceſſary to him that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes with his Hands, whether he be to take out ſharp things, and points of weapons, or to take away any thing, or to cure <hi>Sinus</hi>'s and Abſceſſes aright. Beſides, it is ſo ablolutely neceſſary for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to know by what Muſcles the Arm, Hand, Thigh, Leg and Foot are extended, and again, by what Muſcles they are bended, that an Empirick dare not condemn this knowledge; but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it is very uſeful. But here I would have my Reader under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I ſhall not treat of all Hurts; but only of thoſe which principally have reſpect to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Function, nor of all them neither; but of ſome external ones, whereby ſome conſpicuous voluntary motion is hurt. For the harm that is done to the vital and natural Inſtruments, we do not meddle with here; becauſe upon recovery of the Patient, no
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:52816:236"/>impediment is left in doing his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Affairs. For if the Heart, Lungs, Liver, Stomach, or Veins receive a Wound, it either kills the party, or if he eſcape he can perform vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Motion, and go about his Buſineſs. But I have diſcourſed of this among mortal Wounds. Now therefore that I may have ſome foundation to build my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon, I take it for granted, that a Muſcle is the inſtrument of that Motion, which is at the command of our Will, which we therefore call voluntary or ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous. Nor is there any part any where in the Body (if it have a ſpontancous Motion) but has Muſcles inſerted in it. Now there are three parts of a Muſcle, the two ends which are nervous, and the middle carnous. And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Muſcle, which they call the Head and Riſe, comes from the Bones; but the middle which they call the Belly, has many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres diſperſed in it, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Ligaments and Nerves. The end is called a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, becauſe its action is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and the Muſcle ends in it. It is made up of many mixt Fibres, and is inferted either into a Bone, or into another Muſcle, <hi>i.e.</hi> into that part of it, which is to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Nor is it any obſtacle that <hi>Galen</hi> ſomewhere ſays, that a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not a Muſcle is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of voluntary Motion; and that a Muſcle is made for the ſake of a Tendon: for a Tendon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed part of a Muſcle, and that to which action is principally owing: and the Muſcle is the entire inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that it makes little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether the property of the Function be attributed to the one, or to the other. For the Eye by all Men is reputed the inſtrument of Seeing; yet all the action of Seeing is moſt truly aſcribed to the Cryſtalline Humor, as to the chiefeſt part of the inſtrument.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What Cuts of the Muſcles do hurt what Motions in general?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce therefore it is plain, that a Muſcle is the inſtrument of voluntary Motion; then the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that part, familiar to that Muſcle, muſt needs be hurt, when ſuch a Muſcle is hurt. When Muſcles are cut aſunder and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, Motion muſt needs be loſt in the ſubject parts: When they are inciſed, Motion is only hurt; and the meaſure of the hurt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the meaſure of the Section; more Motion being loſt in greater Sections, and leſs in leſs. And I would have what I have ſaid, underſtood alſo of the Tendons: for if you cut them quite aſunder, you deſtroy the motion of that part; if you make Inciſion, you will ſo far hurt it, as you make Inciſion. And the ſame may be ſaid of the heads of Muſcles. For <hi>Galen</hi> holds, that when the head of a Muſcle is cut, it performs its Function no more. Therefore if a Muſcle have but one head, it is a very eaſie thing by cutting that, to deprive it of motion; but if it have more heads, you muſt cut them all. And whereas we ſaid but now, that all the Muſcle muſt be cut aſunder tranſverſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of motion, I would not have you take it careleſly, becauſe it is not every cutting of a Muſcle, that takes away the uſe of a part; but only that which is tranſverſe, and which (according to <hi>Galen</hi>) is made at right Angles. This a Phyſician muſt know, who has a mind to foreknow the hurt of a part, thô it be difficult: for all Fibres, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike according to the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Muſcle; but ſometimes have a various compoſition: Thus ſome Muſcles have a ſimple ſort of Fibres, others have a double, ſo that they look like ſeveral Muſcles, one lying upon another. Beſides, ſometimes the Fibres differ in length. And a Man ought exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider theſe things, who would compleat himſelf in the predictions about them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, this manifold variety of Fibres need not trouble us much. For Muſcles have generally their Fibres tending length-ways; you ſhall but ſeldom find them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or oblique, conſidering the multitude of thoſe that run length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. And <hi>Veſalius</hi> attributes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Fibres only to three ſorts of Muſcles; namely, to thoſe that draw the Arm to the Breaſt; to the Second, that moves the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> which have twofold Fibres, and to thoſe that move the Cheeks and Lips.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Some general Inſtructions very uſeful for Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEfore I come particularly to ſpeak of wounded parts, I would premiſe ſomething in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which will be of uſe to what ſhall be ſaid afterwards. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Firſt of all I would adviſe you of, namely that all Wounds received in the outſide, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Body, do always hurt Extenſion; and what are received in the inſide, Flexion. For <hi>Galen</hi> has abundantly demonſtrated, that the internal Muſcles ſerve for bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part, and the external for ſtretching it out. A Muſcle ſo long operates, as it is contracted towards its beginning, and draws the part moved toward that: whether it be done by drawing the whole Muſcle to that they call the Head, or when it is drawn in a lump. Beſides, this is to be taken ſpecial notice of, that whether it be the external or internal Muſcles that are cut aſunder, in both, the figure of the part remains immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For neither extenſion alone, nor flexion alone periſhes in a part, but both thrive, and both periſh together. Not that the operation really periſhes, whoſe Muſcles are entire; but becauſe theſe motions ſucceed one another by turns. For if the internal Muſcle, which bends the part, be whole, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal which uſed to extend it, is cut; at firſt indeed it may bend the part; but it cannot bend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, unleſs you extend it with ſomething elſe; becauſe Flexion is of a part extenſe. The caſe is the ſame, when the internal Muſcle, which is the bender, is cut, if the external be not hurt; this will extend at firſt; but no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: Unleſs with your Hand you ſupply the loſt operation of the wounded Muſcle, by extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is bent, or by bending what is extended; for then the ſound Muſcle will perform its operation. This alſo I muſt not paſs by in ſilence: ſince ſome parts of the Body are diſtinguiſhed by many Joynts, that the function of that part where the Wound is made, is not always hurt; but of an adjoyning part, which is tied to the wounded part by Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Muſcles are derived from the ſuperjacent Bones, wherein there are <hi>Cotyle,</hi> and are inſerted after the beginnings of the ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which are to be moved: and by theſe intenſe Muſcles, when the Heads are drawn upwards, the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:52816:237"/>whole Member is drawn up with them. Wherefore if a Wound will hurt the Functions in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, it muſt be inflicted in the <hi>Brachium;</hi> if it will hurt thoſe of the <hi>Brachium,</hi> it muſt be Inflicted in the <hi>Scapula,</hi> or parts thereabout. And you muſt remember this alſo, that the uſe of a part does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways periſh by the cutting of one Muſcle: for if the uſe be peculiar to ſome one peculiar Muſcle, and competent to no other, we muſt believe the part will be made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe deprived of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that one Muſcle. But if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Muſcles conſpire to one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the detriment of one of them is not ſufficient to deſtroy the whole action of the part.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF one receive a Wound in his Forehead, eſpecially near the Eye-brows, where the Fibres are carnous, if it be made length. ways, and according to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Fibres, after it is brought to a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> there is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no hurt of the Function left. But if it be tranſverſe, and more than ſuperficial, you may ſay, that the Eye-brows and all the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Skin ſhall be drawn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and thereby create no ſmall trouble to the Eyes, which lye under theſe parts; becauſe the Eyes cannot afterward open freely, nor perfectly do their Office. And this may be the bare and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as to the demands of the Court. But that you may not ſeem only to have reported the truth, but to have done it with judgment: It were beſt ſometimes to ſhew the riſe and inſertion of the Muſcle, which is the inſtrument effective of action, and the duct of the Fibres; and ſeveral other things beſides, which may ſeem proper upon the occaſion. If therefore at any time you are called to make a report concerning a Wound in the Forehead, you may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate theſe things, to what has been already ſaid; Namely, that <hi>Galen</hi> calls this ſubſtance, which lies upon the Forehead, and ſticks moſt tenacionſly to it, not a Muſcle, but a Muſculous Skin: And that <hi>Veſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> will have it to be not a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colous, but a Carnous Membrane, full of many carnous Fibres. But <hi>Fallopius</hi> is of another opinion, and ſays it is a perfect Muſcle; becauſe the Motion and Fibres atteſt as much. <hi>Realdus</hi> alſo holds there are two Muſcles, and he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:52816:238"/>ſaw one ſide of the Forehead Convulte, and the ſound ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in its Function: And in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection he has found the ſame thing; and moreover he ſays, that theſe Muſcles are terminated in that common Suture, which diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Bones of the Head from the Bones of the upper Jaw. And theſe Muſcles have no Tendon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a Bone, but only a Skin that is to be moved. And <hi>Veſaiius</hi> ſays, that the Fibres which are principally to be conſidered, do run in a direct line from the top of the Noſe to the middle of the Forehead. <hi>Cohonbus</hi> ſays, the Fibres are not ſtreight, but oblique from the top of the Noſe to the middle of the Forehead. The uſe of the part is, to draw up the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows. And thus what we have diſcourſed concerning Wounds of the Forehead, you may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to the preſent occaſion, as it ſhall offer it ſelf. Thô here I muſt not omit what <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> mentioned in <hi>Coac. Prenot. viz.</hi> That the Sight is darkned by Wounds which are inflicted on the Eye-brows, or a little higher; and the freſher the Wound is, the better they ſee; and when the Wound is, after a long time heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sight grows duller. For, as <hi>Hollerius</hi> declares, the Eyes grow ill by reaſon of the vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſent in the adjoyning Bone by common Membranes, and certain Veins, and they grow duller in the proceſs of the diſeaſe, that is, when the Ulcer is difficult, and flow in cicatrizing. Alſo the upper Eye-lid (for the lower is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable) if it be wounded in the ſpace between the corners of the Eye; it is no difficult matter from the nature and ſite of the Muſcles, if the Wound be tranſverſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the total loſs of the Function in the Eye-lid, if the weapon reach deep: But if the cut be not deep, you may ſay, that all the hurt which ſhall befall the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, will be, that it cannot ſhut cloſe. Now there are two Muſcles in the upper Eye-lid: an oblique one reaches from the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Noſe, reaching half way of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> and this draws the Eye-lid: And another oblique one ariſing from the Eye-brow near the leſs corner of the Eye, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the reſt of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> whoſe Office it is to lift up the Eye-lid. And it behoved the riſe of either Muſcle to be ſuch; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſary that all Muſcles tend towards their proper princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And thô <hi>Fallopius</hi> does here obſerve, that the former Muſcle ariſes not (as he ſays, <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Veſalius</hi> thought) For oftentimes that place uſes to be hurt and cut, as in curing an <hi>Aegilops,</hi> and yet no hurt of the Eye-lid follows. Then he obſerves, that this Muſcle has its original from the inner part, whence another alſo proceeds, which raiſes the Eye upwards. But <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, 10 <hi>de uſu partium,</hi> 10.

                        <p>The Functions of the Cheeks and Lips; alſo of the lower Jaw and Maſtication, by the wounds of what parts they are hurt?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd now to come to the hurts of the Cheeks: There lies a certain broad Muſcle under the Skin in the Neck, which <hi>Galen</hi> firſt of all obſerved: It is thin and Membranous; which, if you pleaſe, you may call a Muſculous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or a Muſculous dilatation. It is ſpread round under the whole Skin, which is about the Neck: In the forepart it is carried down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the Clavicle, and behind along the ridges of the <hi>Scapulae</hi> to the beginning of the back. The uſe of theſe Muſcles is to draw the Cheeks from one another to the ſides, without moving the lower Jaw, or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Mouth, which Functions muſt of neceſſity be hurt by a Wound of this Muſcle. This ſort of action is moſt apparently ſeen in the Convulſion, they call <hi>Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Cynicus:</hi> for in it this Muſcle is extremely ſtretcht, and contracted toward its original. But that you may make no ſlip in your Report; you muſt know, the Fibres of this Muſcle do not every where obſerve the ſame duct: for they are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried upward to the Lips, as in that part of the Muſcle, which aſcends from the <hi>Os Pectoris,</hi> and the middle Region of the Clavicle: and they partly run obliquely from the ſame; as in the portion of it, which ariſes from the reſt of the Clavicle, the top of the Shoulder, the <hi>Scapulae,</hi> and the Region of the Neck. So that now you may ſee, what way the wound muſt tend to cut the Fibres tranſverſe, which ſort of Wounds only, as I ſaid before, hurt the Functions. So <hi>Galen;</hi> but <hi>Columbus</hi> a diligent Anatomiſt, diſagrees with him: for he thinks, that the Muſcles, which perform the motions of the Cheeks, are ſituate between the Jaws, and ariſe from the Gums, and end in the Gums; and that this broad Muſcle only draws the Lips obliquely downwards, and ſerves to open the Mouth. The motions of the Lips are thus hart by a Wound. Whereas two Muſcles deſcend obliquely from the Cheeks, and as many aſcend from the end of the Jaw, where the Chin is; the former are conſtituent of and move the upper, and the latter the lower Lip. If therefore
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:52816:239"/>the ſpaces contained within the aforeſaid limits be wounded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the ſaid motions will be hurt. But here you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſider, that the Fibres of theſe Muſcles are interwoven and complicate one within another: So that let the Wound be given which way it will, it is always tranſverſe, and breaks the Fibres. It is no difficulty to find by the hurt of what parts the Functions of the nether Jaw are hurt. For if you inflict a Wound in the Region that lies between the Ear, the Forehead, and the <hi>Os Jugale,</hi> making an imperfect Circle (it is called the Temples) you will then offend the attraction of the nether Jaw upwards, and the ſhutting of the Mouth.

                     <p>BY what Muſcles being hurt the motions of the Head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive damage, take thus. There are ſeven Pair of Muſcles, that are deſtined to the motions of the Head: Only one pair of theſe draws the Head forward: All the reſt draw backward. But all of them lye under ſome other external Muſcles, the exteriour under that they call the Muſculous dilatation, which we ſaid moved the Cheeks, the Poſterior under the <hi>Scapular</hi> Muſcle: Wherefore it muſt not be a ſuperficial Wound, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the motions of the Head. And we muſt not be ignorant of their Original and Progreſs. The two firſt, which incline the Head forwards ariſe from the top of the Breaſt, and the end of the Clavide; they are long, round and ſtrong: They are apparent enough, before the Skin is taken off. They are inſerted into the Mamillary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: If they are both moved, the Head is bent forwards; but if only one act, it is drawn on one ſide. But in the hind part Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts have obſerved ſix pair of Muſcles: All of them tend from the Spines of the firſt five <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> and reach almoſt half way up the hind part of the Head. If then a deep Wound be inflicted in the Neck behind, ſo as to reach the parts under, you will manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt the motions of the Head, according as theſe or the other Muſcles are wounded.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What functions wounds of the Arms do incommode?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WOunds of the Arms are both frequent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Functions that are moſt uſeful to Man. Therefore that you may foreſee the Event of each of them, it is beſt firſt of all to recount the proper Functions of the Muſcles, which do diverſly move the parts of the Arm: for ſo you may eaſily reckon with your ſelf, what hurts will enſue, I will begin therefore with the extreme parts of the Arm. There are eleven Muſcles in all, that move the <hi>Humerus</hi> or Shoulder (I call all that is between the Throat and the Elbow the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and the <hi>Cubit</hi> all that is between the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow and the Palm) three aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Breaſt to the Arm: two from the Region of the <hi>Ilia:</hi> five proceeding from the <hi>Scapula:</hi> And the eleventh lies upon the <hi>Epomis.</hi> All theſe Muſcles grow together, and are implanted, where the Humerary is one. But theſe are their motions. That which lies upon the <hi>Epomis,</hi> draws the Arm right upwards. The two, that come by the ſides of this, from the <hi>Scapula</hi> on each ſide, do raiſe the Arm up; but not ſtreight; but they draw it backwards or forwards, according as they are on this or that ſide. The Muſcles that riſe from the Breaſt, draw the Arm thither. The reſt of the Muſcles turn it backwards, and that eſpecially, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the lower end of the loweſt Rib under the <hi>Scapula.</hi> Now you ſee, by the Wounds of what parts what motions are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: for if the Muſcles, that lift it up, be wounded, without doubt that Function will be hurt; and ſo in the reſt. The Cubit is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by four Muſcles, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs round the <hi>Os Brachii;</hi> and the two former bend the Joint, not ſtreight; but one enclines it inwards and the other outwards. It is extended by that Muſcle which manifeſtly appears near the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral Vein, eſpecially in ſuch as uſe much exerciſe, and it has two Heads, one upon the edge of the Head of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> another upon the Proceſs, and it cleaves to the <hi>Os Brachii,</hi> and then to the <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and it has another under it, aſſiſtent in the ſame action. Therefore when that Muſcle is wounded, the Arm cannot well be bended; but if a Wound be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the hind part of the Arm, which is oppoſite to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Muſcles, and touches their
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:52816:240"/>ends, then the office of bending the Elbow is loſt: for upon that place the Muſcle lies, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Arm; and whether you call it one Muſcle or two, <hi>Veſalius</hi> thinks it is no great matter. Moreover, if a Wound be received on the upper and forepart of the Cubit, between that and the end of the <hi>Radius,</hi> in that long, but narrow place, it will hinder the <hi>Radius</hi> from being raiſed ſupinely: for the long Muſcle lies there, which ariſes from the <hi>Os Humeri,</hi> and is implanted in the lower <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> of the <hi>Radius,</hi> and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecond among them, that draw the <hi>Radius</hi> forward. But if you wound the lower part of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> along to the lower Bone of the Wriſt, you will prejudice all the motions of the Wriſt. For there all the four Muſcles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the Authors of all bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial motion: Of which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the two external, which are moſt liable to the injuries of Wounds, ariſing from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſwelling of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> are inſerted in the firſt and ſecond <hi>Os Carpi,</hi> and ſerve to extend it: Therefore when they are hurt, this Function eſpecially muſt be hurt. But if a Wound be inflicted in the inſide of the Cubit inclining a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle back, then the ſecond Joints of the four Fingers cannot bend. For there runs one Muſcle, the firſt among the internal, which moves the upper part of the Hand, and which ariſing from the lower ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> is hid under others, till it come to the Elbow: but there it ſtarts out, and is ſeen under the Skin; except as much as the former Muſcle (which makes the broad Tendon, where it is thin, and turns into a Nervous end) does paſs over. This then having paſſed the Wriſt, is divided into four Tendons, each of which being ſixt to the ſecond Bones of the Fingers, are their benders. But whatever of the internal Muſcles you cut, which run down with the firſt to the Wriſt, von will manifeſtly hurt the Function of Contraction. The Hand is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly extended by the external Muſcles, <hi>i. e.</hi> by them that are placed in the back part of the Arm. The firſt of theſe having paſt the Elbow, ſtarts up, and is conſpicuous under the Skin; and if you remove another, which lies above it, and extends the Wriſt, you would ſay it lay uppermoſt and foremoſt. This is moſt fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently divided into four Tendons, which come to all the Joints of all the Fingers, except the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger, and dilate them. And the ſecond Muſcle, by which the little Finger is drawn aſide from the reſt, and the Palm is formed, having the ſame original with the former, is to be ſeen under the Skin with the firſt: but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds underneath to the Hand. Therefore in what place ſoever the ſeat of this Muſcle is wounded; either the Function of the little Finger will be hurt, if the Wound be given in the lower Region, or the Function of the three next, if it be inflicted a little above. And ſo much for Wounds of the Arm.</p>

                        <p>What functions are hurt by wounds of the Hand?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt if a Wound be received in the Hand in the back part, where indeed not Muſcles, but the very Tendons creep along, as they paſs to their Joints; it will not be difficult to foreſee, what harm will thence ariſe to the Fingers. For that Finger will be hurt above all the other, next to which the Muſcle or Tendon is offended. Yet I have often taken notice, that when theſe exterior Tendons have been cut, the Fingers nevertheleſs were extended; thô indeed they were a little weaker in exerciſing their Function: For there are certain other Muſcles ariſing in the Palm, which exerciſing the ſame Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of extenſion with the foreſaid, make the loſs of the foreſaid leſs prejudicial to the Fingers. When the Palm of the hand is wounded, you will often find the motion of the Fingers hurt thereby. But thus you may foreſee all. Under that Tendon, which they call the broad one, and which lies next the Skin, there are four Muſcles, which are apt to be wounded from the middle of the Palm to the ſetting on of the Fingers. And <hi>Columbus</hi> obſerves, that theſe extend four Fingers, beſides the Thumb, thô they be internal: Which makes Chirurgeons often admire, how it comes to paſs, that when the outer Tendons are cut, nevertheleſs the Fingers are extended, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are theſe beſides, which partake of the ſame Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And they ariſe from the Tendons of that Muſcle, which, as we ſaid before, bends the third Joint of the four Fingers: And then running to the external part, and being implanted in the third Joint, they extend it. But if you wound a man about the little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that Muſcle will be prejudiced which ariſes from the fourth Bone of the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> and draws it aſide from the other Fingers. If you wound the fleſhy part of the Palm, which is the Ball of the Thumb, you will hurt the Muſcles (there are three of them) that bend the Thumb. For the Thumb (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays) has this thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to and remarkable in it ſelf; that nothing comes to it from any upper part; wherefore the wound muſt be received either in the Thumb, or very near it, which muſt hinder its function.</p>

                        <p>What harm is done by the wounds of the Thighs and Legs.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt, to come to wounds of the Thigh, if a Man be wounded any where in the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock, in that region which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es over half the <hi>Os Ilium</hi> from the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> and <hi>Coccyx;</hi> unleſs the cut be ſhallow, it will hinder the extenſion of the Thigh. For this Muſcle has its riſe from the foreſaid parts, ends at length in the greater <hi>Trochanter,</hi> and makes the Buttock. Obſerve, nevertheleſs, that ſince this Function requires much ſtrength, other Muſcles are aſſiſtent to it; leſt by the hurt of one Muſcle all the Function of the part ſhould be loſt. There are other Muſcles to perform the reſt of the motions of the Thigh; which becauſe they run along the inſide of the Loins, a place not ſeen by the Eies, I ſhall paſs them by. But Wounds of the Thigh do often hinder motions in the Leg. If therefore you wound the Thigh in the fore-part between the top and the knee-pan, you will much injure the extenſion of the Leg. For under that place there lies the ſeventh Muſcle of them that move the Leg, and under that the eighth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Muſcle, conſpicuous above the Knee: yet becauſe it has other Muſcles to help it in this common action, the perfect loſs of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the part need not be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the detriment of one Muſcle. And if you wound that part which deſcends obliquely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from the Groin, like a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, along the inſide of the Thigh, and ends in the Shin, the Leg will find a great impediment, when it is drawn toward the Groin on the other ſide, or to the Thigh. And if the hind part of the Thigh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Wound, between the end of the Buttock and the ham, it hinders contraction, eſpecially if the cut reach to the Tendons, which are ſo manifeſt in the ſides of the ham, that when the Leg is contracted, they may be plainly, felt by the Fingers. And here a Hiſtory of <hi>Galen</hi>'s concerning a Runner muſt not be forgot; which becauſe it is worth the remarque, and that there are ſeveral opinions about it, I ſhall not think much to relate. It is concerning the fourth Muſcle that moves the Leg, which is not indeed in the inſide, but on the outſide oppoſed to three others, and its carnous broad end
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:52816:242"/>is faſtned to the outſide of the Leg; its Function is to twine the Leg obliquely. I ſaw, ſays he, this Muſcle broke in a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Runner, and broke in the middle, as one was contending with him: There was a hollow place in the middle, which the ends of the parted Muſcle left, one being drawn towards its head, and the other towards the <hi>Tibia.</hi> Yet this Runner, after the pain was ceaſed, and the Inflammation abated, was not at all injured in walking; nay, he durſt run again. And when he found no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in it, he ran Races again, and won them: Which might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be; for in running there is no occaſion to twine the Leg about; but only to ſtretch and bend the Leg. But <hi>Realdus</hi> has obſerved ſome wounded in this Muſcle, who, thô they were cured, yet it troubled them to bend their Leg: wherefore contrary to <hi>Galen,</hi> he aſcribes the Office of bending to it. But now to the damages of the Feet. If you wound the Muſcles, which after their riſe, coming up about the Knee, do by their ellies on each ſide of the Leg make up the Calf, and at laſt make the ſtrongeſt Tendon in all the Body, which comes to the Heel; then the Foot cannot well ſtretch it ſelf. But the hurt of this one Muſcle is not ſufficient to deſtroy the whole Function: for four other auxiliary ones lend their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. But between the Calf and the <hi>Os tibiae, viz.</hi> the Shin, two Muſcles are to be ſeen; one next the Calf, whoſe Office it is to extend four of the Toes; but the other, which has in that place a tendinous Nature, runs by the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> its office is to extend the end of the Foot: If you wound either of them, without doubt you will hurt the Functions that are peculiar to them.</p>

                        <p>What Wounds of ſuch or ſuch Nerves, and of ſuch or ſuch parts of the Spine, do hurt the motions of this or the other part?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOw I think. I have mentioned almoſt all places, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extrinſecally hurt, uſe to hinder the motion of certain parts: ſo that, I ſuppoſe, I ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted my ſelf of this particular, when I have added this one thing further; namely, that Motion of the parts is hindred, not only when the Muſcles, but the Nerves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are wounded, which being diſtributed through the Muſcles, are the chief Authors of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays) muſt be underſtood as a maxim in all Muſcles, that whether you hurt their Nerves, or cut all their Fibres acroſs, you will immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive theſe Muſcles of all motion. Therefore it will be very neceſſary for you to know the principles of the Nerves, that are diſtributed into them, and the ſite of their Fibres. It is then a thing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known, that ſtrength and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of moving is derived from the Brain, as the Fountain, by the Nerves as Rivulets. Which Nerves, becauſe they are not ſufficient of themſelves for motion, Nature has contrived Muſcles, as a kind of Levers, that we may the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily raiſe weights. Therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Muſcle has a Nerve inſerted in it, from whence it has its motion. If then you cut, preſs, bruiſe this, or any way intercept the paſs of the Spirits, all motion and ſenſe ſhall be taken away. But as much as remains after the cut, continuous to the Brain, ſo much will ſtill conſerve the virtue of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and whatever is below, can neither aſſord Senſe nor Motion to it: That therefore you may not be ignorant of the hurt Functions of the Muſcles, which proceed from their Nerves, I will briefly declare what Nerves are derived into ſuch and ſuch parts, and from what Originals. But I ſhall not mention all, for that would be too tedious. This I will ſay in general, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Nerves ſeldom come along the outſide of the Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Muſcles; but affecting ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certain ſafeguard and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, they run along the inſide. Yet thoſe that come to the Hand are obſerved to run along the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:52816:243"/>of the Arm: but they do not ſo in the Leg: for they all run along the back part of the Thigh. You ſhall not therefore find a Nerve, neither at the Elbow, becauſe it has no fleſh on it, nor at the Knee or Shin, but always deep among the Fortreſſes of the Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, or Fleſh. As therefore to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Nerves; they that come to the Arm and Hand, creep from the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> of the Neck along the Armpit; and alſo from the firſt and ſecond of the Breaſt, which if you reckon from the beginning, you may call them the eighth and ninth. But theſe Nerves from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning do ſtrangely croſs and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix one with another. Now if you wound any of theſe Pairs of Nerves, as they come out of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> it will certainly much hinder the motion of the Arms and Hands, according to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wound: Yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well tell, what pair of Nerves being in their original, will hurt ſuch and ſuch Muſcles: for as their contexture is manifold, ſo it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what Nerves of the Muſcles depend on ſuch or ſuch a hole of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> Yet it is ſufficient to know, that Wounds received in the foreſaid <hi>Vertebrae</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly hurt the Hands and Arms. Nerves proceed from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins and <hi>Os Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum</hi> in the ſame complication and confuſion, to the Thigh, Leg, and Foot, as we ſaid they went to the Hands, and Arms. Wherefore whatever pair of Nerves proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the foreſaid <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> you hurt; you will likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode ſome of the Muſcles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath. Furthermore (for this will not be uſeleſs to know) you may eaſily, according to <hi>Veſalius,</hi> find out in a living Man, the Nerves which come to the extreme parts of the Hand: For if you preſs hard with your Finger between the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior proceſs of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and the brawn of the Arm; then you will find that there lies the fourth Nerve, which moves the Thumb, the fore, and middle Finger, by a kind of numbneſs in the ſame Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: And if you preſs the end of the brawn on the inſide, you will for the ſame reaſon ſind, that the fifth Nerve lies there, which moves the little, and middle Finger by branches divided to the Hand. If in like manner you preſs the forepart of the brawn of the Arm on the inſide, you will find the third Nerve, which comes to the inſide of the Thumb, the fore and middle Finger, if you conſider, as we ſaid before, the numbneſs in thoſe Fingers. If therefore thoſe Nerves receive a wound about the Elbow, you may eaſily foreſee what Fingers will be hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                     <p>Now there remains ſomething to be ſaid of the cutting aſunder of the Spinal Marrow, which <hi>Galen</hi> 8. <hi>de adminiſtrat. Anatom,</hi> has recorded very opportunely for our purpoſe. If (ſays he) you cut the Spinal Marrow quite through in the region of the third or fourth <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> the Animal will preſently be deprived of breathing, not the Breaſt only, but the whole Body below the Section, becoming immoveable. And it is plain, if you cut below the ſecond or firſt
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:52816:243"/>
                        <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or in the very beginning of the Spinal Marrow, the Animal will ſuddenly fall down dead. But if you cut the Spinal Marrow quite through (for you muſt always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this) all the Muſcles of the Breaſt immediately looſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the Animal then breaths only by the benefit of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm. They allow that in cuts of the Spinal Marrow, lower than this <hi>Vertebra,</hi> many parts of the Breaſt may be moved: For the greateſt conjugation of the Nerves of the upper Muſcles of the Breaſt, has a twofold original of both Nerves. Therefore cuts about the ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> hinder not the function of theſe Muſcles: much leſs cuts under the eighth or ninth. And the lower you go, the more Muſcles of the Breaſt will do their Office. <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe ſays, if the Spinal Marrow be cut length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a right line from above downwards, none of the interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, lumbar, nor crural Nerves will loſe their uſe: but if it be cut croſs only half way, all the Nerves derived thence periſh. But what need a Man trouble himſelf with the hurt of the parts from wounds of the Spine, ſince they generally prove mortal? Becauſe a Wound here is as dangerous as in the Brain. For the Spinal Marrow is a kind of Brain to the parts below the Head: and both <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> do account wounds therein mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:52816:244"/>again. So that you ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> places the nature of Mutilation in the deficiency of the extreme parts, if they cannot be repaired again. But <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that is maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of whoſe Body any part is cut off: And he ſays, that Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are of the Lips, Ears, Noſe, and of any fleſhy parts, either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently taken away, or putrefied and cut off. He ſays, there is a Mutilation of the Tongue, when half of it is taken away, and of the <hi>Omentum</hi> and Privities, of the Noſe and Ears. Wherefore if you will follow <hi>Galen,</hi> you muſt ſay, that is maimed, that hath any part of the Body cut off; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe three parts about the Face. <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſays, they are maimed, who have the Ears, Lips, or Noſe cut off. So the Latins call a Ram or a Goat, without Horns, <hi>Mutili, i. e.</hi> maimed. In the ſame ſenſe ſome have ſaid, that <hi>Faemina veluti mutilus mas à na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura eſt producta.</hi> Theſe things I have gathered, out of ſeveral Authors; Now I will proceed to deliver my own Sentiments.</p>

                        <p>Three ſorts of Maiming.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving well weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this ſubject, there ſeems to me to be three ſorts of Maiming. The Firſt truly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and exquiſite: The Second is true indeed, but not exquiſite: The Third may be called impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The true and exquiſite has theſe three qualities- 1. Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme part of the Face muſt be cut off. 2. Disfiguring muſt ariſe from thence. 3. The action of the cut part muſt be hurt. As when the cartilaginous part of the Noſe is cut off, the Lips or Ears, and (as ſome will have it) the Eye-brow. For in theſe, unleſs the loſs of ſubſtance be very ſmall, there is the firſt ſort of maiming. For an extreme part is cut off; great disfiguring is cauſed it being in the Face; and the actions are a little hurt. If any one demand, why I call this eſpecially exquiſite Maiming, my reaſon is at hand: becauſe in Maiming the ſavour muſt chiefly be hurt, as ſeveral Authors hold; without doubt a Maim in the Face muſt be the principal: for it disfigures the beſt favoured part. Of this <hi>Galen de Morb. dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. &amp; in Meth. Cornelius Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> do treat. And this I obſerve, that when Authors treat cloſely and nicely of Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they make it to conſiſt in
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:52816:244"/>theſe three particulars. But thô three things are required to Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet Disfiguring is the main thing requiſite; and in the next place the hurt of action. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a piece of the Ear or Noſe be cut off, ſo that the leaſt prejudice be done thereby to the Hearing, or Smell: yet becauſe a manifeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring does reſult from thence, it is an exquiſite Maiming. And that is a true, thô not an exquiſite Maiming, which is not indeed in the Face, but in the extremities of other parts of the Body; as in the Hand, Foot, Tongue, Secrets, and Breaſts. It is called not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, becauſe it reaches not any part of the Face, where becauſe of the Favour exquiſite Maiming conſiſts: But there is this in it; it may ſome way or other offend the Actions, in reſpect whereof the Maiming may be ſlight or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. The Third is called Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe it cuts off none of the extreme parts, which is requiſite to true Maiming: Nor does it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure: nay, ſometimes it hurts no action; It is ſufficient that any part is cut off. So <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Omentum</hi> was <hi>Mutilum.</hi> Wherefore I cannot chuſe but wonder at ſome famous Phyſicians, who in Maimed Perſons require on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ceſſation and privation of uſe, without any loſs of part. But how diſſonant this is to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Philoſophers and Phyſicians, (who muſt be judges in this caſe) may eaſily be underſtood by what I have already ſaid. And they that conſider the Force, either of the Latin or Greek words, will ſay as much. Since therefore thing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thus, you muſt know, that not every loſs of ſubſtance makes a Man maimed: For if any one from his Nativity want a Hand, Ear, or any other part, we may ſay he is lame, but not maimed. And if no part be wanting, but a Limb be made uſeleſs for action, it is weak or diſabled.</p>

                        <p>The opinion of Phyſicians concerning the ſignification of a Member.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Court does often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult us likewiſe about the appellation of a Member, in the caſe of Maiming, diſabling, or any way hurting a part. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſt we ſhould report what the Lawyers will not admit in the caſe, it is beſt to treat of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. A Member, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Phyſicians, is often uſed for any part of the Body without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For Fleſh it ſelf, a Nerve, a Vein, and any of thoſe we call Similar parts, are ſtyled by them Members. But what a ſtrange thing would it be, ſhould a Judge ask us about the name of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if we ſhould tell him a Man were maimed, who had only a piece of fleſh cut out? For Lawyers, when they enquire about Members, mean only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound parts of the Body. In this they ſeem to follow <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Hiſtor. Animal.</hi> calls only the compound parts, and ſuch as have under them another ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of parts, and Offices of their own, Members: as the Head, Foot, and Hand. And what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls a Member, <hi>Galen</hi> calls a Part: for 1. <hi>de uſu partium</hi> he ſays, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Bodies have on every ſide a circumſcription of their own, nor are on every ſide joyned to others, theſe are called Parts. And about theſe Members or Parts, which might more properly be called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, you will not find all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of the ſame opinion. For ſometimes you will find that part called an Organ, or Inſtrument, which conſiſts of ſimilar parts; upon this account <hi>Galen</hi> called a Muſcle, Vein, and a Finger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Beſides, that part is by him called an Inſtrument, which is the principal cauſe of any action. So <hi>Galen</hi> called the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Humor the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Seeing. But of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the appellation of a Member, you will find no account among Lawyers. Therefore, not to detain you with many words, you may, as far as relates to our preſent purpoſe, truly call that a part of a Creature (I mean the external) which is able to perform a perfect action. For ſo <hi>Galen l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Meth.</hi> deſcribes it. And thus an Eye may properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Member of an Animal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it alone does entirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the action of Seeing: So the Tongue, becauſe it is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Speech: And the Legs, becauſe they perform Walking: And the Hands, becauſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office is to take hold of things.</p>

                        <p>A more exact account of the true ſignification of a Member.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT that the nature of a Member may be underſtood more exactly, and according to the Lawyers Senſe; you muſt knows, that Action (which <hi>Galen</hi> calls Operation) is nothing elſe but the motion which the part exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, while it is doing, and about its work. So when the Hand is moved to take hold of a thing, that motion is its action: And the end of the action, in which the motion of the Hand reſts, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Uſe: Wherefore Uſe is the end of the actions of the Body. Therefore whatever part it is in Animals, that is able to perform this perfect action of it ſelf, and not by another, it may truly be called a Member. The Eye, Tongue, Hand, Foot are chiefly ſuch. But you muſt take ſpecial notice of this, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, which ſeem to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of performing actions, and nevertheleſs are not Members. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, ſaies <hi>Galen l.</hi> 1. <hi>de uſu part.</hi> are required to the performance of actions: For ſome are called great; as the Hands, Feet, Eyes and Tongue, which are made for the ſake of the whole Animal: And others are leſs, which are ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the foreſaid parts: For whereas the Eye is it ſelf a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Member, it has ſome parts by which it ſees; others without which it cannot ſee; ſome for better Sight's ſake; others for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Now all theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which ſerve the principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are not truly Members, but only parts of a Member. And if you conſider theſe things well with your ſelf, it will not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find, what part in our body is truly a Member in the Lawyers ſenſe, and what is not. For thô <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid very truly, that the Tongue was a Member; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inſtrument of Speech: yet he never called the Lips or Teeth ſo: becauſe theſe only ſerve the Tongue to act the better, but are not able of themſelves entirely to perform an action. For the Lips, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 2. <hi>de part. Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:52816:246"/>they exerciſe going, are truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Members: But the Feet and Toes, becauſe they only help the action, are Particles ſubſervient to the Legs. Wherefore when a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is cut off, I cannot ſay that a Member is cut off: for the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hand is not thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, its action is only dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: For the ſame reaſon I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call either the Ears or the Noſe Members: For the Ears are not the inſtruments of Hearing; but only the end of the paſſage, where it is joyned to the dilated Nerve: for all things beſide, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it in the winding paſſage, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help the inſtrument of Hearing: Nor is the Noſe the inſtrument of Smelling, nor therefore a Member: Becauſe the ſenſe of Smelling is contained in the anterior Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain. For the carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous part of the Noſe, and the Bone it ſelf, or the inner skin of the Mouth, only do this for the <hi>Ammal,</hi> that Smells may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be perceived. Therefore if the Teeth, Lips, Ears or Noſe be cut off, you cannot ſay a Member is cut off: for thô theſe parts were taken away, yet the Animal will be deprived of no action thereby. It is plain that Womens Breaſts, becauſe they are the inſtruments of making Milk are Members; ſo are Mens Stones, becauſe they make Seed: And the Yard, becauſe of the neceſſity of it to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>PLato</hi> tells us, that <hi>Beauty is a Gleaming or Ray of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good, immitted firſt into Heavenly things; and then into Ment Minds, the Figures of their Bodies and Voices, which moves and delights our Minds by Reaſon, Seeing and Hearing.</hi> Here you ſee, Beauty is nothing elſe but the ſplendor of the Divine Eſſence, conſpicuous indeed in all things; but ſhining more illuſtriouſly in the more noble, and in ſuch as God has placed nearer himſelf; in other things it is leſs illuſtrious. This is that Beauty, which every where we deſire in the things we love. And therefore Lovers are ever ignorant of what it is they love: becauſe it is GOD. Now this ſplendor, which is altogether incorporeal, our Soul does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed perceive by Touch, Taſte, or Smell, becauſe theſe faculties are very much immerſt in Matter; but rather by Reaſon, Sight and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are more ſpiritual. And whereas this Beauty is diſcerned in three things, in the Mind, in the Body, and in the Voice; that of the Body (which we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign only to treat of) is alſo a Gleam, or Ray of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: but conſpicuous only in a matter apt and prepared. This preparation conſiſts in three things, Order, Meaſure, and Features. By Order is ſignified the diſtances of the parts. By Meaſure, their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. By Features, the lineaments and colour. The foundation of theſe preparations, is a temperate Complexion of the four Elements. This then is the Beauty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which we perceive by the Sight: for that of the Mind we muſt perceive by the Mind, and that of the Voice by the Ear. And this is the Divine Philoſophers Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Beauty. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> does not derive its nature from ſo high an Original; only thoſe things which <hi>Plato</hi> calls Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, them he calls Beauty. For 13 <hi>Metaphyſ. cap.</hi> 3. he ſays, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Beauty are <hi>Ordo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuratio &amp; definitum,</hi> where he takes <hi>Ordo</hi> for the right diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the parts, whereby each is put in its right place: <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuratio,</hi> for the mutual proportion and juſt intervalls of them: <hi>Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> for the bound or limit of each part. So that with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that is a beautiful Body, which has its parts aright placed, at a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another, and of a juſt Magnitude. Thô the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:52816:247"/>has ſaid theſe things learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly enough; yet the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of colour, that <hi>Plato</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and which contributes much to Beauty, he mentions not at all. Wherefore I ſhall cite <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> who has copiouſly and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſcourſed of Beauty. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſays he, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Phyſicians and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, conſiſts in an apt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to a Finger, of all the Fingers to the Palm, and Wriſt; of them to the Elbow; of the Elbow to the Shoulder; and of all to all. And thô in this place he have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the proportion of pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs, what is omitted here, he has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in another place. For <hi>l. d. def. Med.</hi> he ſays, that Beauty conſiſts in a Symmetry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts, with a probity of colour. And, <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>ad Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyb.</hi> he ſays, true Beauty conſiſts in a freſh colour, moderate ſtore of fleſh, and in a congruous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts. Thus far <hi>Galen,</hi> who when he had diſcourſed as to the reſt concerning Beauty ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; yet he makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the limits, and juſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Body; becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was not his deſign there, to give an exact notion of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If therefore you put <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> together, Beauty will be <hi>an order or, proportion of parts, with goodneſs of colour, and a decent magnitude.</hi> Nor were it much matter if you ſaid, that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is neither the order nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts, but an affection of the whole, and a quality ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thence: for great Authors take an honeſt liberty in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the order of parts, and an affection ariſing thence.

A third part of the heighth of the Face is from the bottom of the Chin to the loweſt part of the Noſe: the Noſe to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Eyebrows as much: from thence to the roots of the Hair as much, which makes the Forehead.

Eight lengths of the Head make the talneſs of the Body: And the extenſion of the Arms ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, ſhews the ſame; and ſo do the Feet extended. By follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which proportion <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> found out the Stature of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> exactly; as you may ſee in <hi>Gellius.</hi> The goodneſs of colour in temperate Men, as <hi>Galen, Art. Med. c.</hi> 51. ſays, ariſes from a decent mixture of White and Red. For, becauſe Blood is of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors moſt abundant in us, which is Red; and becauſe Phlegm is next in quantity to it, which is White; it was meet that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:52816:248"/>of the whole Body ſhould be made up of them two: for it is according to nature. And ſuch a colour is required in the whole Body. Indeed in ſome certain parts there is a peculiar beauty of colour. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> commends Eyes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured like Goats Eyes: becauſe ſuch Eyes are a ſign of a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and are the beſt to ſee with. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo commends yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Hair above all. But one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well determine the juſt length of Mans Body: for as to ſeveral Nations ſeveral Statures are more familiar, ſo they may ſeem more beautiful. So <hi>Hippocrates l. de aere, loc. &amp;c.</hi> ſays, the Aſiaticks are of a large Body: the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Scythians are well ſet. The Europeans are of a different ſtature. Moreover, Men are generally tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than Women. And as for ages, in young Men, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 2. <hi>Apli.</hi> 54. writes, tallneſs is comely and gentile: but in aged people uſeleſs, and worſe than ſhortneſs of Stature. Wherefore the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature of the place, Sex and Age muſt be conſidered, before you can well judge of the juſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But if you deſire to find ſome certain ſtature of Man, which may be moſt exact, and as it were a rule, or ſtandard for the reſt (for all things that are, have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature, and determinate magnitude) I ſhall in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure gratify you, in acquainting you, that the meaſure of four Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits is moſt convenient for a Man's length: under which a Man muſt be called ſhort; and above which, over tall. Therefore the Spaniards, becauſe they are ſhorter, and the Germans, becauſe they are taller, cannot well be called handſome: But the Italians and Greeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of a ſtature between both, are upon that ſcore account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed handſome.</p>

                     <p>AS for theſe things, wherein we have before ſaid, that Beauty did conſiſt, I think it is no great matter, whether you call them <hi>Species</hi> or Parts. For if you exactly conſider Beauty, Order, Feature, and a juſt Magnitude will be its conſtituent Parts; none of which can be wanting in making up an exact Beauty. For let one be endued with order of parts, and a good colour; yet if he have but a little Body, he cannot be called beautiful. According to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 4. <hi>Mar. c.</hi> 3. who ſays, that little People may be called pretty, but not beautiful.

But if your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not ſo exact and ſevere, and you think it ſufficient, that what we call falt, have moſt or only ſome Ornaments, but not all; I ſhall readily grant you, that a good Colour, an exact proportion of Parts, and the reſt have each of them ſeverally their peculiar Beauty. And thus Men of a little Body may nevertheleſs be called Beautiful or Handſome. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is worth the marking, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Univerſal <hi>Idea</hi> of Beauty, different Ages, and different Sexes have their particular Beauties. For the ſame Favor is not requiſite in Women, that is in Men. As ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Countenance, and aſſurance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Men; ſo a kind of Softneſs and Modeſty becomes Women. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Beard is an Ornament to a Man, but not to a Woman. And as for Ages, <hi>Ariſtorſe</hi> ſays it is the Beauty of a young Man, if his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be ſo made, that it is able to endure labour, or to run, or to act violently: thô he muſt have a ſweetneſs of Countenance, which may pleaſe the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That of an old Man is, to have a Body ſufficient for neceſſary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, to ſhew no ſadneſs, and to want thoſe Diſeaſes, that uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprave old Age.</p>

                     <p>BEcauſe Disfiguring, or the ſpoiling of one's Beauty, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> or Scar, it will be worth while, for avoiding obſcurity, to declare what a Scar is. A <hi>Cicatrix</hi> or Scar, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation is Fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed and dry, and hard like a <hi>Callus,</hi> coming inſtead of Skin, which is not true Skin, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like it: for the Skin, becauſe it is a ſpermatical part, cannot be generated anew; and therefore ſomething like it grows in its room. But this account of a Scar makes little to our purpoſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt give another account o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or apparent. I call that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, which manifeſtly offends the natural comelineſs of the Face; and that apparent, which does it but obſcurely. The deform or ugly Scar requires two things. Firſt, it muſt ſpread over a good part of the Face. Secondly, it muſt leave ſome unevenneſs in it, either bunching or hollow. If the Scar be broad in the Face, I think no Man will deny, that it is ugly, becauſe ſo conſpicuous; unleſs it is only in the Scarf-Skin: for in time that will grow out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be termed ugly. And it is a manifeſt deformity, when ſome parts of the Scar ſtand out, and others fall in, and no equality is obſerved. The Scar apparent is ſo called, not that the deformed Scar is not apparent (for on that very account it is deformed) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does but juſt appear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much prejudice to ones Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is the property of this Scar, that unleſs it be narrowly looked upon, it cannot be diſcerned: Whereas the deformed may be ſeen, if a man caſt but his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>

                        <p>In what Parts, and for what Reaſons, a Scar is more or leſs deformed?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>VVHereas there are two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table differences of Scars; nevertheleſs the condition of each is not always the ſame: For the deformed is ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs deformed: and ſo the apparent is ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs apparent. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this difference is grounded (to omit nothing material in the point) upon the parts of the Face, and the greatneſs of the Scar. A Scar therefore in the Noſe is in my mind the moſt deformed: next to that, in the Cheeks: then in the Lips: next them, in the Eyes: then in the Forehead: and laſtly in the Ears. Becauſe ſuch Scars disſigure the Face extremely. I put the Noſe in the firſt place; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it performs very noble Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but becauſe it is principally expoſed to view, as being in the middle of the Face, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent alſo. I know, ſome do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a Scar in the Eyes is moſt deformed: Indeed if the Uſe of them be conſidered, I ſhall not contradict them. But now, not the Uſe but the Beauty of a part is under conſideration: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Eye that has the Optick Nerve obſtructed and ſees nothing, may appear Beautiful to look on: ſo that Beauty depends not on uſe or action.

                     <p>And (which more confirms me in my opinion) we find it recorded in the Laws of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> that they who were caught in one Theſt, ſhould have one Eye put out: and they, who were found guilty of two Theſts, ſhould have their Noſe cut off. So that from hence it is apparent, it is a greater puniſhment, and more a mark of diſgrace, to be without a Noſe than without an Eye. It is alſo ſaid, that a certain King of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> (according to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. ab Alexand. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſome delinquents not with death, but by cutting off their Noſes; ſo that others beholding the uglineſs of their Faces, might be deterred, from their crimes. Thus it appears, ſome people account it more grievous to loſe their Noſe than their Life. As for a blemiſh in the Eye, it does not near ſo much disfigure a Man. The Ears are put in the laſt place, becauſe they are ſet behind the Face, and not eaſily diſcerned.

                        <p>Some Cautions in judging of Scars.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving diſcourſed ſufficiently concerning the nature and difference of Scars, I muſt now caution you in giving your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about them, that you do not eaſily nor raſhly judge of a freſh Scar. At firſt it always appears bigger and more deformed. Wherefore it would be better to tarry a while, till the reliques of the Fluxion, and the proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Part, which ſwell and diſcolour the Scar, are diſperſt, and the part returns to its natural ſtate: for then the mark of the Wound will not lie; and ſo you may then make a true Report. But if time will not be allowed you, and you muſt give your opinion preſently; You may ſay, that time will take off much of the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; eſpecially when the Party is young, and of a good complexion. This alſo you muſt take notice of (as <hi>Celſus, l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 4, has obſerved) thô a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> or Sear may be brought upon moſt places; yet it proves otherwiſe in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:52816:250"/>juſt above the Eye-brows, if the Bone be much hurt: for then an Exulceration will go near to laſt as long as one lives, which muſt always be kept covered with Lint and Plaſter. <hi>Paraeus</hi> gives the Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe there is a cavity under the Bone, which teaches to the <hi>Os Cribroſum</hi> of the Noſe, full of Air, which hinders the coming of it with Fleſh: Or becauſe the Bone is there ſo thick, that enough of alible Juice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have paſſage out thence for the regenerating of Fleſh. Beſides, there is a great conflux of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the Ulcer, which uſed to run out at the Eyes and Noſe. This alſo you muſt not forget, that ſometimes a foul Scar is left after a ſmall cut. The blame whereof lies ſometimes on the Chirurgeon, who either cloſed not the Lips of the Wounds as he ought; or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied improper Medicaments: Sometimes on the Patient's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and other external errors: And ſometimes on the foulneſs of the Patient's body. And if ſometimes we lay a mans death, though he were wounded, to the bad Humors in his Body, or to a bad Diet, or to ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal error, why may we not do the ſame in Scars, when a ſmall Wound leaves a foul Scar? One may ſay then, that he does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge indeed, the Scar is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but it is not ſo from the nature of the Wound, it being but ſmall; but either from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlineſs of the Patient, or from ſome other external error. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if the Scar be ſuch as that it can be covered either by the Beard or the Hair; you may call it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deformed; but by accident it may be ſo far from being deformed, that it is not apparent.

In the Bones indeed Bleeding need not ſo much be feared, as in the fleſhy parts, unleſs the Fracture be with a Wound: for no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Veins or Arteries go to the Bones: becauſe they are hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, their heat is little, and little of their ſubſtance can be waſted. Yet here we are mightily afraid of an Inflammation, even more than in a fleſhy part. The reaſon is, Pain cauſes attraction, then becauſe of their weakneſs many Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are both received and bred there, which cannot be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fractured part. And that which increaſes the danger, is, the Bones often lye deep buried in much fleſh.

                     </argument>
                     <p>COme we now to theſe things that only reſpect the cure of the Fracture it ſelf. This ſort of cure is in Greek called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in Engliſh Bone-ſetting. Firſt of all we ſhall treat of a tranſverſe Fracture without a Wound. In this Fracture the Indication is the union of the Bone, which cannot be done by the firſt Intention, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Children; but by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it may, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Callus,</hi> growing over, and ſurrounding the fractured parts. The intentions of Cure here are, Firſt, to put together the parts of the fractured Bone aright. Secondly, to keep the parts ſo put together. Thirdly, to take care of the cure of the parts. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to endeavour to breed a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> Fifthly, to correct ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>That the parts may be rightly joyned together, there is need of extenſion and coaptation. For in Fractures, eſpecially the tranſverſe, becauſe the Bones are diſtorted, and the ſtreightneſs of the part is loſt, it ſo happens, that ſome parts ſtick out, and others are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And becauſe one part of the fractured Bone lies upon the other, the Limb of neceſſity muſt be ſhorter: for the Muſcles ever draw the Limb towards their Original. Wherefore Extenſion is neceſſary, whereby the Chirurgeon may ſet the ends of the Bones directly one againſt another, which lye not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and may put the riſings up into their Cavities. And tho ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Limb ſeem not to be too ſhort, (as when there are two Bones, and but one broken, or when one end of the Bone rides not upon the other) nevertheleſs, if the Coaptation be made as it ought, Extenſion muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be made in all tranſverſe Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for the ſhivers of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Bone would be in danger of breaking off, ſhould we without Extenſion direct and turn round the diſtorted Bone, or rub the ends one againſt the other. And if the ſhivers break off, then they either fall between the ends of the Bone that ſhould be joyned, and ſo hinder Coaptation; or they ſlip
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:52816:253"/>beſides the Bones, and then they cauſe pain by diſtending and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nervous Parts. And all theſe inconveniences are prevented in Extenſion.</p>
                     <p>However Meaſure muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Extenſion: for if it be more violent than is requiſite, it cauſes great Pain, whence Fevers, Convulſions and Palſies often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. <hi>Galen com.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de fract.</hi> writes, that ſometimes the Muſcles have been pulled aſunder. If the Extenſion be leſs than it ſhould, the Shivers will rub one againſt another, and ſo break, or they will not be lodged in their proper Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities. Therefore big Bones and great Muſcles, which draw a part ſtrongly toward their Original, require violent Extenſion: Such Bones are firſt the Thigh, next the Shoulder and Leg, then the Arm, then in the top of the Hand and Foot; eſpecially if both the Bones be broke. The <hi>Radius</hi> in the Arm, that is, the upper Bone, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires but ſmall Extenſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Bone has not Muſcles to draw upwards: for it moves any downwards and ſupinely. You muſt alſo obſerve a due figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Limbs be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Figure, which cauſes the leaſt Pain: And this is done, if the Fibres of the Muſcles be ſtretched directly, and the Muſcle be kept whole in ſome part of the Limb. Children, and ſuch as are of a ſoft habit of Body, endure more violent Extenſion: Grown People and hard, on the contrary. Then we muſt conſider the time of Fracture: for if the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon come the firſt day, he may the more powerfully extend. But if he come after the firſt day, he muſt either not extend at all, or more gently; becauſe of the influx of Humors, or for fear of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, according to <hi>Celſus, c.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>The Inſtruments of Extenſion are threefold. Firſt, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Hands, for a weak or ſmall Extenſion. Secondly, Cords and Strings for a moderate Extenſion. Thirdly, Inſtruments and Engines for a ſtrong one.</p>
                     <p>When therefore you have let go your extending Inſtruments, a good coaptation of the parts of the Bone muſt be made, which we may know by three Signs. Firſt, if the fractured Limb be uniform in Figure with the ſound. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if no hollowneſs, roughneſs, ſtanding up, or inequality be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the broken Bone.

                     <argument>
                        <p>How the Parts of the broken Bone may be kept united.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe ſecond intention of Cure is, to keep the parts united. This is done by Bandage, which muſt be ſo made, as to keep the parts ſet together, and to keep them from Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes three Rollers of Linen, not too courſe, leſt it preſs the part; nor too fine, leſt it tear.</p>
                     <p>He rolls the firſt Roller thrice about the Fracture, a good way on the part, ſo as to make three or four or more turns. By this means the Fracture is fortified, while the Roller is turned thrice round it: Alſo the Humors are liept off from coming into it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the upper parts: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roller is carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Roller, which is twice as long as the firſt, he rolls the contrary way: for if the firſt were rolled to the right hand, this is rolled to the left, that if any Muſcle were drawn too much to one ſide by the firſt Roller, it may be reſtored to the contrary by the other, which muſt be rolled once about the Fracture; then to preſs Humors out, it muſt be carried downwards a good way of the Limb, <hi>i. e.</hi> by making three, four or more rollings, if there be need; then it muſt return upwards again by the Fracture, making a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution upon the very Fracture, till he comes to the end of the firſt Roller, where the ſecond alſo muſt terminate. This Roller, as I ſaid, is firſt rolled about the Fracture, that it may preſs the Humors from it; then it is carried downwards, to ſtop the Humors, which might flow from the lower parts, as to a weaker: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is fear of a deſcent of Humors from the upper part; therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> does not end the Holler downwards, but rolls it upwards, that it may end where the firſt ended. Theſe two Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do more prevent Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than ſtrengthen the Fracture: for more Circumvolutions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this.</p>
                     <p>Having done thus, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> puts over the Bandage Compreſſes of linen Cloth three or more times double, of the form of a Roller, but narrow, that five or ſix or more of them may be applied lengthways round the Fracture, of
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:52816:254"/>the ſame length with it, as many of them, as are requiſite about a Fingers breadth one from another. They are to be ſpread with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cerote (for if there were a great deal, they would ſlip, and not hold.) They are called <hi>Plagulae</hi> and <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> from their oblong form. They ſupply the place of a glutinative Medicine, and beſides, they aſſwage pain, while they hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Rollers.</p>
                     <p>The third Roller faſtens the ſaid Compreſſes. The firſt turn of this Roller is made upon the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, then one head of the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is carried upwards, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downwards. This is to be obſerved, That the Rollers muſt be drawn ſtraiter upon the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured part, than any where elſe; that it may the better be kept from defluxions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celſus c.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 8: has another way of Bandage. For firſt, he applies about the Fracture linnen Cloth dipt in Oyl and Wine. Then he takes ſix Rollers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is ſhorteſt, this is rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thrice about the Fracture, and thrice alſo above the upper part of the Limb. The other Roller twice as long is rolled from the Fracture downwards; and then turning upwards, it muſt end in the upper part above the firſt Rollers. Theſe are the two firſt Rollers of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Over theſe a broad linen Cloth ſpread with Cerote muſt be brought to faſten them. And where the Bone ſticks out (for the broken Limb has always a propenſity that way, which it had a propenſity to in breaking) evermore a linnen Cloth three or more times double; dipt in the ſame Oyl and Wine muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied over againſt the part whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fracture inclines. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I uſe Cloth, ſometimes Tow, which I dip in rough black Wine, when I have a mind to ſtrengthen the part, and prevent Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or in the white of an Egg, if the Fracture is without pain, and I have a mind only to keep it faſt. <hi>Celſus</hi> dipt in Wine and Oyl of Roſes, when Pain was grievous. Over this he brings the four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Rollers. So that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing muſt always roll contrary to the former, and the third muſt end below all the reſt above.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celſus</hi> his Bandage differs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from that of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes three Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; <hi>Celſus</hi> ſix: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes Compreſſes; <hi>Celſus</hi> broad linnen Clothes: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes Cerote; <hi>Celſus</hi> Oyl and Wine. If any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable pain afflict the part, <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his Bandage is beſt: but if there be little or no Pain, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> his Bandage is better, which is moſt approved of by <hi>Galen, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>Meth.</hi> The Moderns preſently take a Roller, and roll the Fracture to both ends, not at all regarding what either <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> or <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays. But it is our beſt way, to follow the beſt of Phyſicians.</p>
                     <p>The Patient's good tolerance muſt be the meaſure in binding. the bandage muſt preſs lightly, ſo as to keep the Fracture firm, and preſs out the Humors. But there are other ſigns, which appear the next day. For if the Patient, that day the bandage was made, found himſelf bound tight, and the next day a lax, ſoft and ſmall Tumor
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:52816:255"/>appear (in the Hand, if the Arm were broke; in the Foot, if the Leg) the bandage is good: But if either no ſwelling at all, or a great and hard one appear in the Hand or Foot the next day, the bandage is bad; becauſe the firſt does not keep the Fracture faſt; the latter occaſions Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>On the third day after deligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> unbinds the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: for about that time they grow ſlick, which is one reaſon why they are unbound. Another reaſon is, becauſe moſt frequently in Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, an intolerable Itch diſturbs a Man, becauſe of Humors and Vapors detained by bandage, and grown ſharp; which itching uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ends in a painful and inſlam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory excoriation. Then the Rollers muſt be unbound, and the part troubled with the Itch, muſt have warm water often poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to make the Humors and Vapours evaporate. Then the Limb muſt be bound up again. Good bandage being made, and the Itch being no more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the Patient muſt be kept bound from the third till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day: On the ſeventh it muſt be opened again, be bathed in warm water, and bound up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>But at this time, inſtead of <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> or compreſſes, you muſt uſe <hi>Ferulae</hi> or Splints (ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls them.) In our time, becauſe we have no ſtore of <hi>Ferulae,</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons uſe thin ſlices of Wood called Scabbard, which they wrap in Tow: Some uſe Paſtboard: others uſe pieces of Wood an Inch thick. The uſe of theſe is to keep the Limb not only immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but ſtreight: And this <hi>Fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>How the ſubſtance of the Bone may be kept ſound.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE third ſcope of curing Fractures is, to conſerve the ſubſtance of the Bone ſound: for Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> the temperature of the part, cannot unite the Bone, except the part be ſound. Becauſe the fractured part then is weak, ſo as that the Excrements of the Body do eaſily flow to it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its weak action many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements breed, and cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; and beſides, becauſe in a broken Bone, thô never ſo well ſett, yet certain holes remain, that are afterward filled with <hi>Sanies:</hi> Therefore to keep the part ſound, we have need of Medicines, that dry up the influxed matter, and repell the influent, which in a word, are called Aſtringents.</p>
                     <p>The matter of this remedy is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes Cerote; <hi>Celſus,</hi> Linen dipt in Oil and Wine. Among the Moderns, ſome uſe Linen wrung out of black rough Wine: ſome, combed Flax, wrung out of black rough Wine: others take Oil and Wine, and with them mix equal quantities of <hi>Bol. Arm. Sang. Drac. Myrtil. Balauſt. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. Rub.</hi> Others, beſides theſe Powders, mix the white of an Egg, and make a Medicine as thick as Honey, and apply it upon comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Flax, or upon a piece of Linen. Some take the white of an Egg, and black rough Wine, mixing the foreſaid Powders without a Cloth or Stupe, and apply it round the fractured Limb: And theſe Medicines, becauſe of the white of the Egg, grow preſently dry, and ſtick faſt to the part. Some wind Rollers, wrung out of black auſtere Wine round them, to make them ſtick the faſter.</p>
                     <p>As to the uſe of theſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to be conſidered are, Firſt, to prevent Inflammation; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to preſerve the tone of the part; Thirdly, to aſſwage pain. Alſo the ſeaſon of the year, the habit of the Body, the Age, and Magnitude of the Fracture muſt be conſidered. If pain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be urgent, the Cerote of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> ſpread upon a piece of Linen cloth is proper: But over this Cerote another Linen cloth, wrung out of black rough Wine, muſt be applied to prevent Inſlam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. If the Cerote be made of Wax and Oil of Roſes, or Myrtils, it will aſſwage pain by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Oil; it will prevent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and ſtrengthen the Fracture by reaſon of Aſtriction, Thô the pain be but ſmall, it muſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:52816:256"/>not be neglected: but our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aim muſt be to prevent Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſtrengthen the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: therefore we take <hi>Oleum Roſ.

And by theſe Medicines the ſubſtance of the part is kept ſound: all which muſt be applied before bandage is made.</p>
                     <p>Next to bandage, ſucceeds the poſition or collocation of the Limb.

But if the Patient be confined to his Bed, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than to make a Caſe of thin boards, and fill it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with Tow or Wooll.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE fourth Intention is to breed <hi>Callus.</hi> This muſt be done, when all danger of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is over: uſually about the ſeventh day, according to <hi>Galen c.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>Meth.</hi> thô it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be done ſooner or later, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of the Fracture, ſeaſon of the Year, Age, habit of Body. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſt as we ſaid in the cure of a ſimple wound of the fleſh. For while we are in fear of a Defluxion, we cannot thînk of breeding a <hi>Callus;</hi> becauſe the nature of the part being hurt, it cannot breed <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Callus</hi> is bred of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Bone, which owz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the edges of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, grows concrete about the fractured Bones: And though it be not Bone; yet it is ſo hard, that if that Limb chance to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again, it will rather break in any other part, than where the <hi>Callus</hi> is bred. Here are therefore two Indications, Firſt, to ſupply congruous Matter, Secondly, to keep it from being waſhed, or any way got off the edges of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                     <p>As to the matter of <hi>Callus,</hi> the Food muſt be thick (becauſe the aliment of Bone is thick) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo viſcid: wherefore we muſt uſe, Rice, Wheat boiled in Water, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the Feet, Stomachs and Heads of Animals, eſpecially of Calves and Weathers: The Skin alſo of a Kid or Weather may be given, and Neats-feet. Wine muſt then be given, and that black and thick. And the Diet from low muſt be altered to high.</p>
                     <p>Medicines alſo may be given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, which are good to breed and harden the <hi>Callus.</hi> So <hi>Succus primulae veris</hi> may be drank for ſeveral days together, <hi>Pulvis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum agrimoniae</hi> drunk in Wine, or <hi>Succus ejus</hi> drunk alone.</p>

Thus therefore we provide Matter apt for breeding of <hi>Callus,</hi> both by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and Medicines.</p>
                     <p>But leſt this Matter, of which <hi>Cailus</hi> ſhould be bred, might be thruſt forth, we muſt alter our ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: for the part muſt not any more be ſo bound, as to preſs out the Humors, but ſo as that they may continue there, and grow together about the <hi>Callus.</hi> The Fracture therefore need not be bound ſo frequently as before; once in five days is ſufficient. The Rollers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be drawn looſer. Yet in the firſt bindings, you need not tarry ſo long, but you may ſee how the <hi>Callus</hi> in the Fracture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds: It is long enough therefore to tarry two days between the openings: And then you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether as much, and ſuch a <hi>Callus</hi> breeds, as is requiſite. But how you may help a <hi>Callus,</hi> when it is leſs or greater than it ſhould be, I ſhall ſhew you afterwards.</p>
                     <p>In a Fracture made length-ways, the ſame cure muſt be uſed as in a tranſverſe: Only the bandage muſt be ſtraiter, otherwiſe it would be apt to ſlip.</p>

                     <p>If a Gangrene ariſe, we muſt immediately bath the part in a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> wherein <hi>Scordium</hi> and Plantain have been boiled: Then a Plaſter muſt be applied, made <hi>è farina Lupinorum, pulvere Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii, &amp; Oxymelite, cum modico lixivio.</hi>

Thô ſome good Chirurgeons are timorous (as <hi>Albucaſis</hi>) leſt the <hi>Callus</hi> ſhould not, when broke, re-unite.</p>
                     <p>The operations in all ſimple Fractures are ſo exactly alike, that to inſtance in particular caſes, would be but to repeat what has been already ſaid. Only the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Patella</hi> or Knee-pan differs from all other Fractures in cure, as that Bone differs from all others in ſite and connexion. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus Obſ. Chirurg.</hi> 88. <hi>Cent.</hi> 5. has this relation. A Man forty years old, ſtrong, and of a good habit of Body, by a fall broke his Knee-pan tranſverſe, with a great contuſion of his Knee; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Wound. Though the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was all along treated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art; yet moſt acute pain, and other Symptoms followed. At length the pain and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ceaſed; but he halted, and had an exceeding great weakneſs in that Leg, ſo that he had much a do to walk, and if he climbed
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:52816:258"/>any place, he could ſcarce lift his Leg up. Several things were uſed to ſtrengthen the Nerves; but all to no purpoſe. And here it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as <hi>Paraeus</hi> has obſerved, that halting generally attends a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Knee-pan. Some are of opinion, that the cauſe of the lameneſs is, becauſe the <hi>Callus,</hi> which joyns the fractured <hi>Patella,</hi> fills the Cavity underneath, and ſo hinders the motion. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance of the <hi>Callus</hi> is rarely ſo great as to do this. And in this Patient the <hi>Callus</hi> could not be the cauſe of lameneſs, as by what follows will appear. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be conſidered, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella</hi> may be broke tranſverſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, or lengthways in a right line drawn from the Thigh to the great Toe. Now a Fracture length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will not cauſe lameneſs, if an expert Chirurgeon have the handling of it: for he may eaſily joyn the disjoyned <hi>Patella,</hi> and keep it in its place, by Bolſters, Pledgets, and Rollers, when joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He may do it eaſily, I ſay: for the ends of the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Muſcles, that move the Leg, do meet about the <hi>Patella,</hi> and terminate in a very ſtrong Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which Tendon does ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the <hi>Patella,</hi> that if it is broke lengthways, the Fracture is apt to cloſe of it ſelf; becauſe it is the property of Muſcles to draw towards their Original. So when the Fracture is made, according to the rectitude of the Bone, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, Muſcles, and Tendons, it is conſentaneous to Reaſon, that they muſt return to their place again; and when the edges of the fractured <hi>Patella</hi> are immediately joyned, and that exactly; there can be no extuberance of <hi>Callus,</hi> and therfore no lameneſs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Chirurgeon has done his duty in applying proper Topicks, and has obviated Pain, and other occurring Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>But when the Fracture is made tranſverſe, the caſe is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for then the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Muſcles, draw towards the Hip, and the Tendon inſerted in the <hi>Patella,</hi> draws downwards; and then it is ſo disjoyned in the middle, that the edges of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, by reaſon of the ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Muſcles and the Tendon can never be joyned. And that the Fracture was ſuch in the foreſaid Patient, both Ocular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and Feeling with my Fingers convinc'd me. For it was ſo disjoyned in the middle, that one might lay more than ones little Finger in the Cavity. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, if from this disjunction of the <hi>Patella,</hi> lameneſs followed, and the Patient could ſcarce draw his Leg after him; ſince the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles that move the Leg, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth, were deprived of their ſtrength. Lameneſs likewiſe follows a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Fracture. For the foreſaid Muſcles and the Tendon draw the edges of the fractured Knee-pan up or down, or tranſverſe, and ſo disjoyn them. Hence it is evident, that a tranſverſe or oblique fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Knee-pan, can never by Art or Induſtry be ſo cured, but the Patient will be lame. Yet <hi>Paulus Aegineta de re Medica. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 103. will have the Leg ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and the Knee-pan joyned with the Fingers, and ſo kept till
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:52816:259"/>the edges of the fractured Bone touch one the other, and are grown together. This may indeed be tried; but I can ſcarce believe, that the edges of the <hi>Patella</hi> can be ſo joyned; or, if they were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Leg can be kept ſtretcht, and the edges of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be kept together ſo long with the Rollers and Pledgets, by reaſon of the pain, as till a <hi>Callus</hi> be bred. But thanks be to GOD, as <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſays, this Fracture rarely happens. And thus we have done with ſimple Fractures.</p>

                        <p>Of curing a Fracture with a Wound, wherein neither the Bone is made bare, nor the coming away of any piece of Bone is expected.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN a Fracture with a Wound, either the Bone is made bare, or not made bare: Beſides, we either look for a piece of Bone to come away, or we do not. We will firſt treat of a Fracture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in neither the Bone is made bare, nor we do expect any piece of Bone to come away. In this caſe we muſt mind the Intentions of the Wound, and of the Fracture one after the other.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all the Bones muſt be put together by extenſion, as we ſhewed before in the firſt indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fractures.</p>
                     <p>Then we muſt anſwer the Second and Third Intention of Wounds, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lips of the Wound muſt be cloſed, and then they muſt be kept cloſe.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards we mind the Third Intention of a Fracture, and the Fourth of a Wound, <hi>i. e.</hi> we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſubſtance of the fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and the wounded part found, by applying Medicaments to the Wound cloſed, and the Fracture ſet, which may aſſwage Pain, if there be any, and prevent Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>i. e.</hi> which may repell the influent Matter, and may dry up what is gathered there already, and preſs out of the part; ſuch as are aſtringents and glutinatives. Of which formerly. If there be Pain, and in Winter time, we muſt uſe <hi>Ceratum picatum:</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſwages pain; In Summer we muſt uſe <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum;</hi> at other times, <hi>Ceratum ſimplex.</hi> If there be no pain, we muſt moſt endeavour the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the Fracture, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an Inflammation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt apply combed Flax,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:52816:259"/>wet in the Whites of Eggs, or a Linen Cloth wrung out of black Wine, and Oil of Roſes. If the part be void of pain, we may uſe the foreſaid aſtringent Powders, mixt with the white of an Egg.</p>
                     <p>Then we muſt ſatisfy another Intention of a Fracture, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fracture muſt be rolled, as we ſhewed before. But here we muſt obſerve, that the Rollers muſt be ſofter and broader than in a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture without a Wound, that they may reach over the edges of the Wounds on each ſide, and ſo may cloſe, not preſs the edges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Of a Fracture with a Wound, wherein the Bone is not made bare; but we look for a piece of Bone to come away.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE ſay, there is a receſs or abſceſs of a Bone, when a piece of Bone is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the main Bone, and is thruſt forth by nature. This comes to paſs, Firſt, when after an old Wound, the Bones are dry and withered; for then the periſhed Bone is ſeparated by the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty of the part, and ſo there is an abſceſs, or deſquam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Bone: Which may likewiſe happen without a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as in <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> and old Ulcers, by reaſon of much <hi>San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es,</hi> tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long upon the Bone, and corrupting it. Such a deſquam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may alſo happen in a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture not Set, by reaſon of much <hi>Sanies</hi> gathering there. Secondly, Bones recede, when ſome piece by the violence of the Fracture, is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite ſeparated from the reſt; or ſo ſhattered, that it is in a manner ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of this are either
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:52816:260"/>external violence, or corruption of the Bone, either by <hi>Sanies</hi> tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long there; or by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the external Air, which corrupts the Bones, and deſtroys their natural temper.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns which ſhew that a Bone will recede, are various. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 18. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Fracturis.</hi> The Firſt is, too much <hi>Sanies</hi> comes away, not proportionable to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Wound, which ſhews the Bone is corrupt, and will come away. Secondly, the Wound looks as if it enclined to excretion, the the Lips of it do not cloſe; but are rather inverted; and if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent narrowly mind it, he feels a tacit motion in the inſide of his Limb. Thirdly, if the Bones have been deprived of Setting, then by reaſon of the continuance of the <hi>Sanies,</hi> which corrupts the Bone, a piece of the Bone will come away. The fourth ſign is, if the Bone be made bare of Fleſh, it muſt neceſſarily recede; becauſe Aliment cannot be given, ſince neither Veins nor Arteries go to the naked part; and alſo becauſe the Bone is expoſed to the external Air, and is corrupted by it. The Fifth ſign is laid down by <hi>Paulus Aegineta, c. cog. l.</hi> 6. If the Fleſh, which grows about the lips of the Wound, be lax, dull and ſpongy: for Nature heals not the Wound, while it has ſomething within it, which ſhe cannot keep. A Bone therefore will come away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the Fleſh is lax.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a very quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion are, when there is a quick ſuppuration in the Wound, and an early and fair excreſcence of fleſh; for the way the Bone does recede is, when Nature creates Fleſh in the lips of the ſound Bone, which keeps off and thruſts forth the fractured. A great ſolid Bone, in a full grown Perſon, in winter time, recedes ſlowly, in threeſcore days or thereabout. A midling lax Bone in tender years, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time recedes ſooner, uſually within forty days.</p>
                     <p>As for the cure; If the Bone that will recede, be quite ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the reſt of the Bone, and is fallen within the Wound, and ſticks there, it muſt be taken hold of with a pair of Pliers, and drawn out. And if a piece of Bone be quite cleft from the main Bone, but remains in its place; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, becauſe it will never glutinate with the reſt of the Bone, it muſt be taken hold of and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, if it can without violence. If it cannot be done without great violence, it muſt not be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe Pain, Inflammation, a Fever, and Convulſion would be cauſed, and there would be a fiſtulous Ulcer when ſuch a Cavity was filled, after the extraction of the Bone, with <hi>Sanies,</hi> which by corroding, hinders the fleſh from breeding. Then therefore this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs muſt be left to Nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which by degrees breeds fleſh in the lips of the ſound Bone, and cauſes Bones to recede, as in the wounds of the Head.</p>
                     <p>It ought alſo to be conſidered, whether the piece of Bone, that is to come away, be great or little. This may be known by the intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or remiſsneſs of the fore-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſigns. For if Suppuration proceed ſlowly, and great ſtore of <hi>Sanies</hi> appear; alſo if much lax
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:52816:260"/>and dull fleſh breed, a great piece is to come away; if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a little one.</p>
                     <p>If a ſmall portion of Bone be to come away; Firſt, we muſt take care, that the gathered <hi>Pus</hi> tarry not long in the Wound, and ſo corrupt the ſound Bone: The <hi>Pus</hi> therefore muſt be evacuated, not by preſſure of bandage drawn tight (as in a Fracture without a Wound) for ſo Pain and Inflammation would ariſe; but the <hi>Pus</hi> muſt be ſo evacuated, that it may flow out of the Wound. The Second ſcope is, to help the receſſion of the Bone, which buſineſs nevertheleſs in a little Bone, muſt be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Nature; but in a great one muſt be promoted by Medicines. For theſe reaſons <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of looſe bandage, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that the <hi>Pus</hi> may not be ſtopt, but may paſs freely: He does not apply Splints, leſt by compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they might cauſe pain: The reſt he leaves to Nature. This is to be obſerved, that thô you look for a receſs of the Bone, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Wound muſt be ſtitched: for Nature will not heal up the Wound, where the Bone is to come out. The Fracture may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many Rollers, as has been formerly ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>If a great Bone be to recede, the Cure differs in two things from that foregoing: for Medicines are applied, and the manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is peculiar. The Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are; that the <hi>Pus</hi> be not kept in, but run freely, that the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be confirmed, Inflammation prevented, Pain not raiſed, and that a ſpeedy receſs of the Bone be procured.</p>
                     <p>To do all theſe things; as to bandage, many <hi>Plagulae</hi> are to be taken of double linen Cloth, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than to go once round the Limb (for ſhorter would not keep the Fracture ſtable) but ſhorter than to go twice round the Limb (for longer would not be commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, when the Limb is unbound, to renew the applications: for then the Limb muſt be lifted up and moved) that ſo both the Fracture may be kept firm, and without ſtirring the Limb, when both the Heads are looſe, the Wound may appear in looſing. The breadth of the <hi>Plagulae</hi> muſt at leaſt be half an hand; in ſome ſo great, as to take hold of both ſides of the Wound. They are to be carried round, ſo as to croſs one another. There muſt be as many <hi>Plagulae</hi> as are neceſſary, that no ſpace may be left empty: I have often found, it is better to uſe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than too few, for confirming the Fracture; yet ſo, as not to preſs too hard. They muſt be wet in black, auſtere, and thick Wine; for ſo they ſtick the better, they prevent Inflammation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſubſtance of the part ſound: upon which accounts, but eſpecially to prevent Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Galen</hi> not only ſo wet the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulae;</hi> but day and night kept the part wet with ſuch Wine; or he applied Cloaths and Sponges dipt in ſuch Wine; but that the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Wine might not wet all the Chamber and the Bed, he laid underneath, a Leather made like a Canal, to carry the Wine off.</p>
                     <p>But before we apply the <hi>Plagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae,</hi> it is neceſſary to apply Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which in the beginning, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                        <pb n="494" facs="tcp:52816:261"/>ſo long as the Inflammation laſts, may aſſwage Pain, and are good for Inflammation, ſuch as <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum roſatum, Ceratum picatum</hi> is likewiſe commended, eſpecially while <hi>Pus</hi> is breeding: for by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coction, and cauſing Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it prevents Inflammation, becauſe when the Matter is Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate, no harm can enſue. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſometimes uſes Linen wet in Oil and Wine mixt together, when there is pain, and danger of a Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>When the time of Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is over, we muſt uſe all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, that the receding Bone may with all ſpeed be thruſt forth; which though it may be done by Nature; yet it may be helped by Medicines. Things manifeſtly hot do this; <hi>ut Oleum vetus, Cera Citrina, ſordities vaſorum apum ad ignem liquata, cui admiſcebitur pars una euphorb ii, duae tith mali, tres Ariſtolochiae:</hi> this Medicine muſt be uſed in Winter, in adult and hard Bodies, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Avicenna.</hi> In other Bodies and Seaſons <hi>Ammoniacum &amp; bdellium, diſſolutum cum oleo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaceo,</hi> is good. <hi>Cinis lumbricorum terrae, melli admiſtus &amp; impeſitus</hi> extracts a Bone, that is to come away, by a ſpecifick property.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Bone made bare muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together be defended from the alteration of the Air, leſt it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefy and recede. Therefore if the Bone made bare ſtick not up above the Wound, it muſt be covered, not with abſterſive Medicines, which irritate and cauſe pain, nor with oily and mollifying Medicines, which make the Wound foul, but with the natural covering, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Skin. The lips of the Wound therefore muſt be drawn together till they touch, by ſtitching; then the Cure muſt be proceeded upon, as in a Fracture with a Wound.</p>
                     <p>If the bare Bone ſtick out above the Wound, if it can with any eaſe be reſtored unto its proper Cavity, by the benefit of due extenſion, without violence, it muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done; then the Wound muſt be ſtitched, as we ſaid but now. But if the bare Bone ſtick out to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:52816:261"/>high, that it cannot without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be put into its place again; then of two evils the leſs is to be choſen, and the Bone muſt be cut off with a File, a Saw, or ſome other Inſtrument, and made a little ſhorter, and then it muſt be put together, by making a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Extenſion: for this is better, than to leave ſuch Bones not put together, or by violent Extenſion, to occaſion a Convulſion and Death. If after the Bone is cut off it be difficult to put it together, and we fear violent Extenſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in becauſe of the Wound, many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are extended, and great Pain is cauſed, ſo that a Convulſion may be expected: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in this caſe replaces the Fracture as well as he can, and puts in a Chiſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like inſtrument between the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Bones, and raiſes it like a Lever: and ſo the Bones are more extended than the Muſcles, and may be replaced.</p>

                        <p>Of the definition, differences, cauſes and ſigns of Luxations in general.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>LUxation, or putting out of joynt, is called Diſlocation. It is the ſlipping of the Head of ſome Limb out of its proper <hi>Sinus,</hi> into another place. For Dearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, or a Joynt, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for motion, conſiſts of the head of a Bone, and a <hi>Sinus;</hi> In the head it is obſervable, that all Bones which have a round head, have all motions, as in the Thigh and Shoulder: In the <hi>Sinus,</hi> that all which have a deep <hi>Sinus,</hi> as the <hi>Os coxendicis,</hi> are not ſo apt to be put out of Joynt; on the contrary, in ſuch as have a ſhallow Cavity, as in the <hi>Scapula.</hi> But leſt the Bones might eaſily ſlip out of their Cavities, there are alſo Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments: and ſome of them are orbicular, which in all Joynts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the head and <hi>Sinus</hi> round: others are round, and are only in ſuch Joynts as are made for ſtrong motions, as in the Thigh and Knee. Theſe out of a deep Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, are inſerted into the head of the Bone. Now the Joynts that have both ſorts of Ligaments, or that have only the orbicular, but
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:52816:262"/>very cloſe, are difficultly diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the Joynts there is a ſort of unctuous and viſcid Humor, leſt the Bones by their perpetual motion ſhould grow hot and dry.</p>
                     <p>In general there are three ſorts of Luxations. Firſt, when Bones gape, which before were joyned. This happens in three places; when the broad Blade-bone parts from the <hi>Humerus;</hi> or the <hi>Radius</hi> from the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> or the <hi>Sura</hi> from the <hi>Tibia,</hi> as <hi>Celſus</hi> writes, <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>Rhaſes</hi> 15. <hi>contin.</hi> calls it Disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A Second ſort is, when Bones are lengthened, through the laxity and diſtention of the Ligaments; whence it comes to paſs, that the head of the Bone ſtarts a little out of the <hi>Sinus;</hi> yet it is not quite out, but it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be put in. I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this Luxation in Beggars, in the Wriſt and Elbow. The third ſort is properly called Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the head ſlips out of its proper <hi>Sinus,</hi> of which there are no differences; but according as it is more or leſs, <hi>Paul c.</hi> 11. <hi>l.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>If then the head do wholly and perfectly ſlip out of its <hi>Sinus,</hi> it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, by <hi>Rhaſes</hi> Diſlocation: If in part, and but imperfectly, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by <hi>Rhaſes Diſtortura,</hi> or wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Joynts of the Arm, Hand, Leg, Foot, Fingers and Toes ſuffer both ſorts of Luxation; only the Thigh and Shoulder ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a perfect Luxation: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof is the roundneſs of the heads, and thinneſs of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; whence it comes to paſs, that the heads do almoſt touch the edges in a point, and ſo either quite ſlip out of, or come in again to the <hi>Sinus.</hi> Yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, the Shoulder and Thigh may be more or leſs luxated, which muſt be underſtood of perfect Luxation, while they are more leſs diſtant from their natural place. Moreover, this true Luxation may be made four ways, upwards or downwards, to the right hand or the left, <hi>Galen c.</hi> 4. <hi>l. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. Art.</hi> adds forwards or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſort of Luxation is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned only by internal cauſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Humors, mollifying and relaxing the Ligaments. The other two ſorts, namely; the wrenching and true Luxation, are occaſioned both by an internal cauſe, to wit, the Humors, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Joynts, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees fill the Cavity, and thruſt the head of the Bone out of its place: and by an external cauſe, which by violence moves the Bone out of its place, as leaping, a fall, and violent running. But we ſhall only treat of thoſe Luxations that proceed from an external cauſe.</p>
                     <p>There are divers ſigns of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Firſt, when the motion of the Joynt is loſt: for as long as motion is not loſt, thô there be ſuſpicion of a Luxation, yet there is no Luxation. But this ſign is not enough, others muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Second therefore is an hollowneſs appearing in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual place, and on the contrary an eminence on the oppoſite ſide: for the Tumor is ever on that ſide unto which the Bone ſlipt; and the hollowneſs, from whence it is ſlipt: This ſign is diſcovered by the ſight and touch, in the Joynts,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:52816:263"/>which are either naturally without fleſh, or emaciated. The third ſign is, the Limb generally is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for the Bone being ſlipt out of its place, ſince it finds no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, is drawn upwards by the Muſcles; this happens in a perfect Luxation. The fourth ſign is; the Limb out of Joynt is unlike the found one in figure, ſite and longitude.</p>
                     <p>A perfect Luxation is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from an imperfect one, by the intenſeneſs of the aforeſaid ſigns. For if all the motions of the Joynt be loſt, if the Limb be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if there be a great Eminence, and a Cavity, if the Limb be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the ſound one, it is a perfect Luxation: On the contrary, when it is imperfect. The moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of a disjunction, where the Bones gape, is the thickneſs of the Limb above its natural pitch; and where the heads of the Bones meet, the extuberance is greater. That ſort of Luxation, wherein the Limbs are made long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe of the ſoftneſs of the Ligaments is known. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Limb looks, as if it were hung on by thread, and it dangles diſorderly this way and that, becauſe the Ligaments are relaxed, and the Bones do not then touch one another. Secondly, when the head of the Bone is put up, the Limb returns to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral length; and if it be let go, it returns to its accidental length. Laſtly, there is a Cavity quite round the Joynt, into which one may ſometimes put ones little Finger.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Luxation being removed, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a Joynt well Self, are contrary, which ſhew the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate: If there be no more ſigns nor cauſes of Luxation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Avicenna</hi> brings another ſign, namely the craſhing, or ſnap which both the Patient and the by-ſtanders hear, when the Bone ſlips back again into its Cavity. But this is neither a good ſign, nor much to be deſired; becauſe it has two bad cauſes. For either the noiſe is made while the head of the Bone rubs againſt the edges of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> whereby thoſe thin and cartilaginous edges are broken, and ſo go into the Cavity before the Bone gets into it again: and therefore true repoſition cannot be made; becauſe the head can no more turn round in its Cavity, which makes Men lame. Or the noiſe is, becauſe the head of the Bone beats againſt the <hi>Sinus;</hi> which may cauſe an Ulcer, and make the part putrefie, the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages may grow hard, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Bone; and ſo the Bone remains rough, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in motion is occaſioned.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Cure of a Luxation in general.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Doctrine of Luxations is truly Chirurgical; becauſe here all depends on the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Hand, and nothing on Nature. There are four ſcopes in a Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Extenſion, Repoſition, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, Collocation. Extenſion is neceſſary; becauſe the Muſcles contract the ſlipt Bone, and make the Limb ſhorter; becauſe then it finds no reſiſtance. Deligation is neceſſary, leſt, becauſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Ligaments, and the Extenſion of the Muſcles, the Bone might ſlip out again.</p>
                     <p>And the four aforeſaid things muſt be ſo adminiſtred, that the due figure of the Limb may be kept, and Inflammation may be prevented. The Limb muſt be put in ſuch a Figure, as that it may be void of pain. In Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Muſcles muſt on one ſide be kept as they are, leſt the head of a Muſcle ſhould be in the inſide, and the end on the outſide. In Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and placing of the Limb, we muſt obſerve ſuch a figure or poſture of the Limb, as is the mean between the two extreme motions of the Limb.</p>
                     <p>An Inflammation uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in Luxations by reaſon of the pain, that is cauſed, both when the Luxation is made, and after it is made; when the Bone, being out of its place, preſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nervous parts, and pain is cauſed in the Extenſion, when the Bone is replaced. And an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation muſt be prevented, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the part recipient, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per figuration or poſture; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the part mittent. <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole Body, by Bleeding, Purging, and Diet.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all Extenſion muſt be made, as we have ſhewn in Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. Secondly, the Limb muſt be replaced gently, leſt either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, or Attrition of the Head and the <hi>Sinus</hi> one againſt another ſhould be made; alſo twining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout of the head of the Bone muſt be avoided, leſt the edge of the <hi>Sinus</hi> be broke. Thirdly the Limb muſt be bound, leſt it ſlip out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The binding muſt be ſo made, as to keep the natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Limb, and prevent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, by preſſing out the Humors that are got in; and by hindring others from coming in. But before binding be made, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines muſt be applied, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Inflammation, namely Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, which beſides this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, do contract the relaxed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:52816:264"/>and ſtrengthen the part, Such are <hi>Ceratum barbarum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma, de Minio, Oxycroceum, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum ſimplex, Ceratum roſaceum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum roſaceum, Vinum, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Vinum granatorum, Succus hypocyſtidos, decoctum corticum gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum; Balanſtiorum, ovi Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumen.</hi> A compound Medicine may alſo be made <hi>è bolo Armena, Sang. Drac. Myrtill. Cortic. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. pulveriſatis, &amp; miſtis ovi Albumini ad mellis cunſiſtentiam, exceptum hoc ſtupis pexis circa ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulum imponitur.</hi> If there be pain, it indicates lenient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Medicines, <hi>i. e.</hi> things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Inflammation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt proceed thus. If the pain be ſmall, it muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and aſtringents with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Medicines, as Flax with the white of an Egg, muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if pain divert the Cure to it ſelf, the part muſt firſt be anointed with things that aſſwage pain, which yet muſt have an aſtringent Virtue in them, ſuch as <hi>Oleum Roſatum, Oleum Myrtinum, Maſtichinum;</hi> then the aforeſaid Medicine muſt be applied, or a Linen cloth dipt in <hi>Ceratum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaceum,</hi> over which the aforeſaid Stupes muſt be applied. Cerotes muſt not be uſed in the beginning; becauſe by their hardneſs they preſs and cauſe Inflammation: for which reaſon <hi>Galen</hi> before bandage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Linen clothes dipt in ſome juice, leſt by preſſure they ſhould cauſe pain; When theſe things are done, the Limb muſt be laid in a middle figure, leſt it ſhould occaſion pain, The Poſture muſt be ſoft, ſmooth, and high.</p>
                     <p>The Limb thus bound, muſt (as much as may be) be kept im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable for three or four days; But then the Rollers being ſlacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an itching ariſing from the detention of the Vapors, the bandage muſt be unbound, and the itching part muſt be bathed with warm water. Yet leſt the warm water ſhould looſen the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, which rather want aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, therefore, if there be no itching, we muſt not meddle with fomentation. At the Second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, if there be no pain, we may apply ſome <hi>Ceratum,</hi> as in Winter. <hi>Ceratum barbarum:</hi> in Summer <hi>Ceratum de Minio, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma.</hi> About the ſame time alſo, we may apply ſplints of Leather and thick Paper, to confirm the head of the Bone. And thus we muſt proceed, till the Limb ſeem ſtrong enough: About this time it muſt be unbound, and fomented with a decoction of Wormwood, Roſes, Chamaemel, white Oaken Moſs, which do ſtrengthen. Then having applied a Cerote, the Limb muſt be kept for ſome days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out binding, and the Patient muſt be ordered to uſe his wonted exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, but moderately. Thus much of the general cure of all freſh Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
                     <p>Old Luxations have the ſame Indications. Yet theſe muſt be preceded by ſoſtning and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the matter, which is flowed into the Joynt, and about the Joynt. For which purpoſe, ℞ <hi>Rad.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of particular Luxations: and Firſt of Luxations of the Jaw-bone.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>VVHen the Jaw-bone is out of joynt, Maſtication and Speech are depraved. It is very ſeldom, that it is diſlocated: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the head of the Jaw-bone, which is contained in the Cavity, is encompaſſed on every ſide with Bones. Then the Jaw-bone has many ſtrong Muſcles, which keep it in its proper place, and it has two heads, which are not ſo apt to ſlip out, as one is. Thirdly, it has two acute Proceſſes. Fourthly, the Jaw-bone can only be diſlocated one way, <hi>i. e.</hi> forwards, Fifthly, there are few cauſes of the Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jaw-bone.</p>
                     <p>For the Jaw-bone can never be out, unleſs its acute Proceſs ſlip under the <hi>Os jugale;</hi> and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get back again: But this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs cannot ſlip downwards, unleſs the Mouth gape very wide, and it cannot get upwards except in a diſtortion of the Mouth. Yet I have often ſeen the Jaw-bone lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: the cauſe whereof may be a frequent and conſtant motion of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:52816:265"/>the Jaw-bone, both in Maſtication and Speaking, whereby the Muſcles are tired, debilitated, and ſo give frequent occaſion to the luxation of the Jaw-bone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gulielmus de Saliceto,</hi> and ſome other Chirurgeons, not skilled in Anatomy, have written, that the Jaw-bone may be luxated to the left and right, but this is falſe; for behind, the Bone hinders, on the right, the left head of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone hinders; on the left, the right head of the Jaw-bone hinders. It therefore follows, that the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone can be luxated only forwards.</p>
                     <p>And either both its heads are lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, or only one. If only one, 1. That part of the Jaw is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent only forwards. 2. The Chin enclines to the luxated part. 3. The Mouth is diſtorted towards the part, contrary to the luxated part, and the diſtorted Jaw-bone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more eminent. 4. The <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes canini</hi> ſtand underneath the fore-Teeth. 5. On the luxated ſide, the acute Proceſs appears more eminent. 6. The Teeth cannot be ſhut. If the Jaw be out on both ſides, theſe are the ſigns. 1. The whole Jaw is prominent forwards, and not diſtorted, but fore-right. 2. The Mouth keeps open. 3. The acute Proceſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears prominent on both ſides. 4. The lower Teeth ſtand out far beyond the upper. 5. The tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muſcles are very tight and hard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, that unleſs it be replaced preſently, there do ariſe continual Fevers, Sleepineſs, Inflammation, Pain, Convulſion, voiding of Choler, and uſually on the tenth day death. Thô I have had ſeveral ſuch under cure, I never met with any that fared ſo: Yet I believe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is rational enough, that ſuch Symptoms may happen, by reaſon of the Muſcles and Nerves being primarily affected, and the Brain by conſent.</p>
                     <p>In the Repoſition of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, motions muſt be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, that the Jaw-bone made, when it ſlipt out of its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Firſt, the Jaw-bone ſlips forwards, it muſt therefore be thruſt backwards. Secondly, in opening the Mouth it is drawn downwards; therefore it muſt be forced upwards. Thirdly, the Muſcles draw the acute Proceſs upwards; therefore the Jaw-bone muſt be drawn downwards.</p>
                     <p>If the Jaw be out only on one ſide; it muſt be forced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide. We muſt begin with the laſt motions firſt. Therefore if both ſides of the Jaw be out; the firſt action of the Chirurgeon is Traction or Extenſion of it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the Second backwards; the Third upwards. To do theſe things, he muſt put both his Thumbs in his Patient's Mouth, and with his Fingers he muſt take hold of the outſide of his Chin: then the Jaw-bone muſt be forced downwards, backwards, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thus it is eaſily and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replaced. But the Patient's Head muſt be held faſt, that it give not way, when the Jaw-bone is forced backwards.</p>
                     <p>When the Repoſition is done, things muſt be applied to the heads of the Jaw-bone, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which may prevent Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſuch as <hi>Ceratum roſaceum:</hi>
                        <pb n="503" facs="tcp:52816:265"/>In violent diſtention, where there is more need of aſtringence, we may apply Stupes wet in whites of Eggs, adding, if there be need, aſtringent Powders. We muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo anoint the parts of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole temporal Muſcle, with <hi>Oleum Roſ. lumbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bandage is made in this manner; a Roller is applied to the Chin, where it muſt be ſlit a little, that it may take hold of the Chin on both ſides; then on each ſide at the Ears, the Roller muſt be ſlit again, and the Ear muſt be drawn through; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Roller is to be faſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Crown of the Head. And the Patient muſt be kept thus, till the Jaw-bone be ſtrengthened, which it is in one, two, or at moſt three days time: All which time, if there be any danger, the Patient had beſt abſtain from Meat; nor muſt he omit Bleeding, and thoſe things we have mentioned in the general cure of Luxations. But to ſpeak the truth, I ever uſed to apply Medicaments to the place affected, and when there was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to eat, I ordered the Swathes to be looſened.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of a Luxation of the Shoulder.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Shoulder is a great Bone, with a round Head, which is inſerted into the ſhallow <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Scapula.</hi> And this head is ſurrounded only with an orbicular Ligament, which is looſe enough. This <hi>Sinus</hi> has ſome Buttreſſes; for on the outſide of the <hi>Scapula</hi> it has a certain large Proceſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Spine of the <hi>Scapula:</hi> on the upper part it has partly the ſaid Proceſs, and partly the Clavicle: in the inſide it has the <hi>Proceſſus anchoroeides.</hi> Hence it is apparent, that the head of the Shoulder may eaſily ſlip out: for this Joynt is uniform and ſimple, not, as it is the Knee, double. Then the head of the Shoulder which is round, is deprived of a long neck, is inſerted into a <hi>Sinus,</hi> that has no depth in it, and therefore is more eaſily put out of Joynt, then the Thigh, which has a long neck, and is inſerted into a deep Cavity. 3. This Ligament is only ſimple, <hi>viz.</hi> orbicular, (not round as in the Thigh) and it is very lax. Fourthly, the Joynt of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is without fleſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is more apt to ſlip out of its place, than a fleſhy Joynt. But the Shoulder can ſlip no way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept into the Armpits downwards: becauſe there are no <hi>Propugnacula</hi> there, as in other places, and the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:52816:266"/>Shoulder is apt by its own weight to ſlip downwards. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that five times he ſaw the Shoulder ſlip forwards.</p>
                     <p>If the Shoulder be ſlipt under the Armpit, it is in figure very unlike the ſound Shoulder. Secondly, on the top of the Shoulder there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears an unuſual hollowneſs, and under the Armpit, the round hard head may be felt. Thirdly, if the Shoulder be in its natural place, the upper Proceſs of the <hi>Scapula</hi> appears round; but when the Shoulder is out, it appears acute: becauſe the head which made the roundneſs is ſlipt down. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Arm ſticks far from the Ribs, and cannot without much pain be brought to them. Fifthly, the Patient cannot carry his Arm to his Head, becauſe the <hi>Humerus</hi> cannot move upwards: and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other motions of the Shoulder are hindred. Sixthly, the diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Arm is longer than the other, if the Shoulder only ſlip downwards; but it is ſhorter, if it be drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Muſcles. Seventhly, the part is wrinkled at the end of the <hi>Axilla,</hi> in the luxated Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, far lower, and both more forward and backward, than in the found Arm; which ſignifies that the head of the Shoulder is ſlipt downwards. If the Shoulder be luxated towards the fore-part, theſe are ſigns; in the fore-part there is an eminence, in the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part an unuſual hollowneſs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Cubitus</hi> enclines back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, nor are there any ſigns of the Shoulder being out under the Arm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Thigh can only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly luxated: This is true, if the Luxation be occaſioned by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe. But if there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes, <hi>i.e.</hi> Humors gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hardning by degrees, theſe, while they force the head to give way by little and little, may cauſe an imperfect Luxation.</p>
                     <p>The ways by which the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſlipt into the Arm-pit is repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, are according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ten in number, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de art.</hi> but they may be very well reduced to three. The Firſt way is by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumrotation, or Circumvolution, while either the Patient or the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, puts the Hand clench't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pit, ſo that the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle knuckles of the Fingers may force the head of the Shoulder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Cavity. This way is uſed only in Children, and ſuch as have very lax and moiſt Ligaments: But as by this way the Shoulder is eaſily reduced, ſo it eaſily ſlips back again. This way <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, is not according to nature, becauſe not ſo very ſafe. For while we turn round the head of the Shoulder upon the <hi>Scapula,</hi> ſome membranous and nervous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may eaſily be torn, and ſo may the edges of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by reaſon of a conflux of Humors the Chirurgeon is fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Repoſition.</p>
                     <p>The Second method is by a way contrary to that, by which it ſlipt out. If the head of the Shoulder be diſlocated; Firſt, it goes out of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and ſo moves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Secondly, it ſlips down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thirdly, it is drawn back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Muſcles. This way differs from the firſt, becauſe in the firſt, motion is made by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumrotation
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:52816:266"/>in crooked lines; in the Second, motion is made in right lines. In repoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe three motions muſt be made by a way contrary to the ſlipping of it out. 1. From be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind forwards. 2. From the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part upwards. 3. Back again. Firſt of all therefore the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon puts his head to the Patient's Shoulder. Secondly, he puts his Fingers under his Armpits. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he muſt preſs the Patient's Elbow with his Knee, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſitting all the while. Let us ſee now, how theſe operations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the foreſaid Indications. The firſt motion, that muſt be made in reduction of the Shoulder, is forwards, and it is done by putting the Fingers under the Arm-pits. The Knee ſtrengthens this motion, and makes it more eaſie, by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Elbow towards the Ribs, which by the diſlocation ſtuck too far from it: For as when the head of the Shoulder ſlips into the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, the Elbow ſticks out from the Ribs; ſo again, when the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is forced towards the Ribs, the Shoulder moves forwards. By the benefit therefore of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and the Knee, the Shoulder is moved from behind forwards. And the Chirurgeon lays his Head on the Patient's Shoulder, leſt, while with his Fingers he draws the Shoulder forwards, the reſt of the Patient's Body might follow: Or rather (as I have learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) leſt the <hi>Scapula,</hi> which is moveable, ſhould follow: for when the Shoulder is diſlocated, if the Luxation be not new, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficultly replaced, for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon, becauſe when extenſion of the Shoulder is made, the Shoulder does not ſtir out of its praeternatural place, but rather the <hi>Scapula</hi> does move. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> therefore makes the firſt motion, <hi>i.e.</hi> he moves the Shoulder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but he makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two other motions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are effected by the Muſcles: For while the Muſcles are ſound, and the Luxation new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, they draw the Shoulder upwards, and reſtore it to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, if that the head of the Shoulder be not hindred, as it is, while it lies behind under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. This way may alſo be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in another manner: for becauſe we cannot ſo well with our Knee force the Elbow towards the Ribs, inſtead of the Knee we ſubſtitute a Servant, who with his Hand muſt take hold of the Elbow and force it towards the Ribs. And this ſecond way may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in a third manner; the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow may be brought back towards the <hi>Spina dorſi:</hi> for ſo the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is brought forwards: Then with one hand we muſt take hold of the Elbow, that motion may be made upwards; and we muſt lay the other hand hard upon the top of the Shoulder, leſt the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula</hi> might give way, as we ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>The Third general way adds to the Second, Extenſion, which is very neceſſary, if the head of the Shoulder be confirmed out of place; moreover the Muſcles always draw upwards, whence ariſes an Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of drawing downwards by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. This way is performed either with inſtruments or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <pb n="506" facs="tcp:52816:267"/>
                     <p>Without inſtruments in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner. The Firſt is, if the Patient lye, and the Chirurgeon ſit upon the ſame level, taking hold of the luxated Arm with both his Hands, and putting his Heel under the Patient's Arm-pit (the right Heel, if the right Shoulder be out of Joynt, and the left, if the left be out) but before he put his Heel in his Arm-pit, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put a hard Ball, like a Tennis-Ball under the Arm-pit. When this is done, a Servant muſt take hold of the oppoſite Arm, and draw it downwards: And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other having a ſtrong Roller or Girt (broad enough to take hold of the Ball) muſt take hold of both its heads, and draw them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the Patient's Head; and with his other Foot lean upon the top of the luxated Shoulder. Now let us conſider, how the Shoulder may be replaced by theſe operations. The Firſt, who draws the Arm downwards, and the other, who pulls the ſtring upwards, make extenſion and motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Motion forwards is made both by the Ball and the Heel: wherefore the Heel muſt be put between the Ribs and the head of the Shoulder, or the Ball, that the head of the Shoulder may be preſt forward: And the reaſon why the Ball is uſed is, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heel cannot reach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hollowneſs of the Arm-pit (which is made by the Muſcles and Tendons placed on all ſides) yet there, by the benefit of the Ball, the Heel may operate. Two motions are therefore made by the Chirurgeon, the firſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then forwards. The Servant, who draws the ſtring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, makes motion upwards, and preſſing the top of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with his Foot, he keeps the <hi>Scapula</hi> from giving way. The third perſon, who draws the ſound Shoulder downwards, keeps the whole body from giving way to the Extenſion.</p>
                     <p>The other way without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is thus; A Man of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtature, than the Patient, muſt lift the Patient from the ground, and place his Arm-pit upon his own Shoulder, that ſo he may make Extenſion: Then he muſt bring the diſlocated Arm towards his own Breaſt, that the Shoulder may move forwards. Afterwards a Servant putting both his hands behind him upon the Patients Shoulder, muſt draw and preſs that part, leſt the <hi>Scapula</hi> might give way. Then a Boy muſt hang behind on the other ſide, ſo as his Feet may not touch the ground, that he may hinder the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from giving way. Thus far of the ways of doing it without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
                     <p>Inſtruments proper for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the luxated Shoulder are, the Ladder, Coulſtaff, Pulleys, <hi>Gloſſocomium, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The way of Extenſion by a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that the Patient climb up three or four ſteps of it, and put his lame Arm over one of the Staves, placing it between his Side, and the head of the <hi>Humerus;</hi> and that a ſtrong fellow take hold of that Arm, and pull it forcibly down backwards, whilſt the Patient hangs by it.</p>
                     <p>The way by a Coulſtaff is ſafer. The Staff muſt have a Bunch in
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:52816:267"/>the middle, ſomewhat wedge-like, and be covered with a ſoft Boulſter, fit to place under the Patient's Arm-pit. In order to the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Patient muſt be ſeated near ſome Poſt or Pillar, in which the Pulley muſt be faſtned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Arm; and the bandage muſt be made a little above the Elbow; which being faſtned, and the Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff placed, and ſupported by a couple of fellows, the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt ſtand on the contrary ſide, with his hands on each ſide of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> to preſs it downward, and keep the Patient firm in his ſeat, and govern the operation, taking care the edge be placed right whilſt the Extenſion is making, leſt they break the Bone, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe miſchief him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gloſſocomium,</hi> commonly called the Commander, is of uſe in the moſt ſtrong tough Bodies, and where the luxation hath been of long continuance, and will not yield to the other ways of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There ought to be great care in the uſe of it, for many ſhrewd accidents have happened thereby.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Humerus</hi> luxated by relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Ligaments and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons is reſtored to its place, after ſome of the ways aboveſaid: but doth require your induſtry to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, after it is reduced,</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Humerus</hi> be to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when it is luxated forward, the motion muſt be made contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And thô the Limb be not made ſhorter; yet becauſe we eaſe the head of the Bone, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangle it, ſome little Extenſion muſt be made.</p>
                     <p>In general we muſt know, if the Shoulder be newly luxated, it may eaſily be replaced by the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But when the Luxation is old, it is very difficultly reduced: becauſe the Shoulder has fixt it ſelf faſt there, ſo that it is grown ſomething callous; and beſides, the Cavity it ſelf is filled with fleſh, which when the Bone is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, does nevertheleſs cauſe it to ſlip out of its proper <hi>Sinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Shoulder is reduced, we muſt bind it up. But before binding, we muſt apply things, which prevent Inflammation, and knit together the lax and diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ligaments; ſuch as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; <hi>Bolus Armena, Sang. Draconis, Myrtilli, balauſtia pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſata ovi albumine ſubacta, ad mellis conſiſtentiam,</hi> applied with Stupes or Clothes, And under the Shoulder-Joynt a Ball muſt be put, made of Linen or Tow wrapt together, it muſt be wet in the foreſaid Medicines, and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pit, leſt the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by reaſon of its weight, and the laxity of the Ligaments, might ſlip down again. Then a broad linen Cloth, wrung out of black auſtere Wine, muſt be applied. Thirdly, a Roller muſt be brought about it, which muſt keep faſt the Ball, and always draw the Arm upwards, or at leaſt keep it ſo. Firſt of all therefore the middle of the Roller muſt go over the Ball, and be carried once or twice round the Joynt, then both the heads muſt be carried round the Neck on the other ſide. When three or four days are over, the bandage may be looſed: and if all fear of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be not over, or if the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments continue lax, the like
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:52816:268"/>Medicine muſt be renewed, till all fear of Inflammation is over, and the Ligaments are ſtrengthened. And then you may leave off the Roller, and the foreſaid Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and apply ſome Plaſter: in Winter <hi>Barbarum,</hi> and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Diapalma.</hi>

                        <p>Of Luxation of the Clavicle or Collar-bone.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Clavicle is a crooked Bone made in the figure of an <hi>S.</hi> one end of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thicker, and almoſt three ſquare, is inſerted into a Cavity purpoſely ſitted for it in the firſt bone of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and bound in by a ſtrong ligamentous Membrane. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end being broad and flat, is joyned to the <hi>Acromium,</hi> where it not only ſerveth to keep the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at due diſtance from the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> but alſo aſſiſts theſe ſeveral Proceſſes, which are provided by nature to preſerve the Shoulder-Bone from ſlipping upwards from its Cavity.</p>
                     <p>This Bone is capable of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Luxation, one at the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and that only outwardly, where it riſes from the Breaſt, and lies like a lump. The other at the broad end near the <hi>Acromium,</hi> which is alſo ſubject to a twofold Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> upward and forward; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defended from all other diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by its neighbouring Bones.</p>
                     <p>This Luxation is for the moſt part occaſioned by a fall, and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Shoulder. It is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the Prominence it makes.</p>
                     <p>The Clavicle is not ſo ſubject to Luxation as other Bones; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luxated, it is moſt difficultly retained after reſtitution, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ſmoothneſs of its heads, and the little hold they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Acromium</hi> and <hi>Sternum.</hi> And if it be not reſtored, the uſe of the Arm is impaired in ſome of its motions.</p>
                     <p>The reduction of the Clavicle, which end ſoever of it is luxated, muſt be made by drawing that Shoulder backwards, and by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the luxated end even with the <hi>Acromium,</hi> or to the Cavity of the Bone of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> whence it departed. Neither of the places affords it much room, therefore it will require your greater care: for if you place it not exactly, it will ſcarce hold right till you make your applications. Therefore you muſt have ready Emplaſticks, Compreſſes and Bandage. Splints are alſo of uſe, whether they be of Paſtboard, Scabbard; or Tin. The bandage ought to be a Roller
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:52816:268"/>with two heads to come over the Shoulders, and under the Arm-pit, making ſo many circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may retain the Dreſſings cloſe. This being well made, his Arm muſt be kept up with a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin or Towel, and his hand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under his Breaſt. If all be well you ought not to looſen the band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age till you judge it united, which may be gueſſed at by the eaſe and uſe of the Arm.</p>

                        <p>Of the Luxation of the Elbow.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Elbow is very difficultly both luxated and reduced, according to <hi>Hippoc. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. Gal. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Fract.</hi> Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is multiform and various, not round. Secondly, the Bones that make up the Joynt, do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receive, and are received one of another; wherefore this Joynt is called <hi>Ginglymoeides,</hi> becauſe it is made like hinges. Thirdly, the Ligaments of this Joynt are very tight. Laſtly, the Bones are not two, as in moſt Articulations; but three, the <hi>Cubitus, Radius,</hi> and <hi>Humerus,</hi> which are mutually knit one to another by membranous Ligaments.</p>
                     <p>Unleſs the luxated Elbow be quickly replaced, moſt violent pain enſues; becauſe its great head preſſes the circumjacent Muſcles and Nerves that run to the Hands, and the deep and ſharp edges prick the ſaid part. Beſides, the <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> increaſes the pain; for if it be out, there are more preſſures; if it be not out, there are great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſions of the nervous bodies. This pain is uſually attended with a Fever, vomiting of Bile, Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cubit is luxated forward or backward, outward or inward: and the <hi>Radius</hi> either follows, or abides in its place.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Radius</hi> follow, the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Radius</hi> from the Cubit may be felt by the touch. If the Cubit be luxated forward, theſe are the ſigns; we cannot bend the extended Cubit, the Cubit is made ſhorter, an unuſual Tumor appears in the fore-part, and an unwont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cavity behind. If the Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made backward, the ſigns are the ſame; but that the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor appears behind, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity before. If it be luxated out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſigns are the ſame, but the Tumor appears outward, and the hollowneſs inward. If it be luxated inward, on the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The luxated Elbow muſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be replaced, otherwiſe a great Inflammation ariſes, becauſe of the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:52816:269"/>pain, upon which the luxated El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is quickly grown callous, the thin Matter being diſperſed; but eſpecially becauſe the Elbow is leſs nervous, and of a cold temperament. When the Elbow is grown hard, it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, unleſs it be mollified with Medicines.</p>

When this is done, the luxated Cubit may be replaced four ways. Firſt, if the Luxation be imperfect, it is repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a quick bending of the Arm. Secondly, in a perfect Luxation, Extenſion muſt be made; then ſome hard and round body, as of linen Clothes wrapt up hard, muſt be put in the bending of the Arm, then the Elbow muſt be bent. Extenſion muſt be made by two Servants, one of which muſt draw the <hi>Humerus</hi> up, the other the Cubit down, but oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the round body put in the bowt of the Elbow, muſt be preſt, that when Inflexion is made, Repoſition may be made alſo. Thirdly, two Servants muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe extend, and a Girt muſt be applied to the luxated Arm, and bound ſo long hanging down, that the Chirurgeon may put his Foot into it, as into a Stirrup; Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefore being made, and the Girt drawn down by the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Foot, the Chirurgeon muſt then put his Hands to the Cubit, and preſſing it backward muſt bend it. Fourthly, this is uſually done with the Hands alone, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Cubit in one Hand, and the <hi>Humerus</hi> in the Other, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit muſt be bended, and put into its place again.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be backwards, having made Extenſion obliquely, a freſh Luxation is eaſily replaced by the Hands alone. But becauſe in this caſe extenſion uſes to prove difficult (for the exteriour extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Muſcles of the Cubit, are very ſtrong) the Chirurgeon muſt anoint his Hands with Oyl, that the Muſcles may be the more pliable: And if the Strength of the Hands be not ſufficient to reduce the Cubit, we muſt uſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Inſtruments, the Ladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Cubit ſlip inward or outward, it muſt be forced the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way. When reduction is done, Medicines muſt be applied to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage pain; to contract and ſtrengthen the lax and diſtorted Ligaments, and to prevent Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: the firſt whereof is done by oyly things; the reſt by aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; where we muſt conſider what is moſt urgent.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Luxation of the Thigh.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Thigh has a round Head, growing in a long Neck, which is inſerted into a very deep <hi>Sinus.</hi> The Thigh is bound to the <hi>Os Coxendicis</hi> by two Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the one orbicular, and the other round. Hence it is apparent that only a perfect Luxation can happen in the Thigh, and not an imperfect one, as we ſaid before of the Shoulder. The Thigh ſlips forward, backward, outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But it is done with great difficulty. Firſt, becauſe of the very ſtrong Muſcles, and abundance of Fleſh upon thoſe Muſcles, which keep the Thigh in its proper <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Secondly, becauſe of the depth of the <hi>Acetebulum.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe of two tight and ſhort Ligaments. The Thigh is ſeldom luxated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward, becauſe in theſe ſides the edges of the <hi>Aceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi> are higheſt; ſometimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, becauſe there they are not ſo high; oftneſt inward, becauſe there the edge is loweſt. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the lowneſs of the edge I may add the round Ligament, which is inſerted next the inſide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will more eaſily give way to Luxation of the Thigh inward.</p>
                     <p>If the Thigh be luxated inward; it appears longer than the other, becauſe the Thigh deſconds. Alſo the Knee, Leg and Foot ſtand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; For if one end of a thing encline one way, the other end will encline the contrary: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Head of the Thigh be diſplaced inward, the Knee, Leg and Foot encline outward. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Thigh cannot be brought toward the Groin; becauſe the inflexor Muſcles are ſtraitned and hindred, that they can neither lift nor bend the Thigh. Another ſign is, that on the Region be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Anus</hi> and the Teſticles, a manifeſt Tumor appears in the outer ſide of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> If the Thigh ſlip outwards, the ſigns are contrary: for that Leg is ſhorter than the other, becauſe the Head is more elate than its <hi>Sinus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Scretum</hi> and the <hi>Anus</hi> there is a hollowneſs; and towards the Buttocks there is a ſwelling. The Knee, Leg and Foot ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Heel cannot touch the ground, becauſe the Leg is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but the Patient can draw his Thigh upward, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexor Muſcles are not hindred. If the Knee ſlip forward, the extended Thigh cannot be bent, becauſe the inflexor Muſcles are hindred and preſſed by the head of the Thigh.
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:52816:270"/>Urine is ſtopt in ſuch Perſons, becauſe the head of the Thigh preſſes upon the Bladder. The Groins ſwell, be cauſe the head of the Thigh is ſlipt into theſe parts. The Buttocks appear wrinkled and without Fleſh; becauſe the whole Thigh, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Proceſſes, is ſlipt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If the Thigh be ſlipt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, there are the contrary ſigns. The Leg cannot be extended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extending Muſcles, which are behind, are preſt; wherefore they cannot be drawn toward their proper Principles; the Thigh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected is ſhorter than the other, becauſe the Head is got above the <hi>Sinus;</hi> the Heel cannot touch the ground. The Groin appears lax, and the head of the Thigh ſticks out at the Buttocks.</p>
                     <p>It is very difficult to replace a diſlocated Thigh; becauſe, by reaſon of the very ſtrong Muſcles, extenſion cannot be made: and the difficulty is encreaſed, if the Luxation be not new, but callous by reaſon of Humors running to the <hi>Os Foemoris,</hi> and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> The Thigh being replaced, it is apt to ſlip out again, becauſe the Muſcles are ſo weakned, that they are not able to keep the heavy Thigh in its Seat; and becauſe the round Ligaments is either la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ated, or broken.</p>
                     <p>The Thigh may be replaced, either without or with extenſion. Without extenſion two ways, but never unleſs the Luxation be new, and moderate, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſtanding but a little way from its <hi>Sinus,</hi> and in a Child's Body. The firſt way is, to turn round the head of the Thigh about the <hi>Hium</hi> (as we did when the Arm was out of Joynt) and not to ſeparate it, if it get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sinus.</hi> But this way is not ſafe, for fear leſt the head of the Bone ſhould rub againſt the edges of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and ſo either bruiſe or break them. The other way is, to bend the Thigh ſuddenly: for ſo ſometimes it is replaced accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paulus, c.</hi> 98. <hi>l.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>But the Thigh is beſt reduced with extenſion. If therefore the Thigh be ſlipt inward, thô there ſeems to be no need of extenſion, ſince the Leg is longer than it ſhould be (not ſhorter, as in other Luxations, wherein the Muſcles moving the head of the Bone, have their Original far above it, and ſo draw the head upwards) never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a little extenſion muſt be made, as much as is ſufficient to ſtir and extricate the fixt head. This may be done with the Hands, if the Luxation be new, moderate, and in a Child's Body. It muſt be performed in this manner; one Servant muſt hold the Patient's Body by the Armpits very faſt; another muſt take hold of the Thigh with both his Hands above his Knee, and extend it. In the mean time, while extenſion is making, the Chirurgeon muſt with his Hands force the Thigh ſlipt inward, outward. When the Head is thus extricated by means of this impulſion, the Muſcles that draw upwards, will eaſily put it into its place again; or, if the Muſcles be weak, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon may eaſily do it. If it be in a robuſt Body, we want ſtronger extenſion, which muſt be with Girts and Ropes. A Girt then
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:52816:271"/>muſt be put on the ſpace between the Genitals and the <hi>Anus;</hi> but ſo, as that it do not take hold of the head of the Bone. Then another Girt muſt be tied above the Knee, or another above the Ankle: and theſe Girts muſt be drawn by the two heads, either with the hands alone, or with a Ladder, to one of the ſtaves whereof the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Girt muſt be tied, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt be laid on the Ladder, and the other Girt muſt be drawn downward. You may alſo uſe the <hi>Scamnum Hippocratis.</hi> But theſe violent Extenſions are moſt proper in other Luxations of the Thigh, when it is put outward, forward or backward: for when Extenſion is made, and the head is forced the contrary way, the Chirurgeon may eaſily reduce it. After reduction, Medicines muſt be applied, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Inflammation, aſſwage Pain, and to contract and ſtrengthen the lax Ligaments.</p>

                        <p>Of the Luxation of the Knee.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Knee is not eaſily put out of joynt: becauſe it has two Ligaments, and it has a double head, and a <hi>Sinus.</hi> It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes an imperfect and a perfect Luxation, and it ſlips outward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or backward: only <hi>Celſus</hi> adds forward; but ſo it is very hard for the Knee to be luxated, becauſe of the Knee-pan, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tied by very ſtrong Tendons, does wonderfully ſtrengthen the Knee forward, ſo that it cannot ſlip that way; unleſs there be a violent cauſe.</p>
                     <p>All the forts of this Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are manifeſted to the Eyes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a fleſhleſs part: for there appears an unuſual Tumor on one ſide, and a Cavity on the oppoſite; the Figure is depraved, Motion is weakned and aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be imperfect, little or no Extenſion is required, but only forcing it to the contrary ſide. If it be perfect, Extenſion is neceſſary; which may be made by the hand in a freſh Luxation, and in Childhood. One Servant muſt draw upwards, and another below the Knee towards the Foot; and the Chirurgeon muſt force the Bone to the contrary ſide. In a grown Man, and a great Luxation, there is need of Girts or Engines, eſpecially to draw downward, and make ſufficient Extenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Of the Luxation of the Ankle and Toes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Ankle may ſlip out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, outward, forward or backward. If inward, the Sole of the Foot turns outward: if outward, on the contrary. If forward, then the broad and ſtrong Tendon in the Heel, is hard and tight: beſides, that Foot is leſs; becauſe the Leg and Joynt is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved forward, and takes up a great part of the Foot; whereupon the Foot is leſs and ſhorter. If back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Heel is almoſt hid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Joynt is ſlipt to the Heel: beſides, the Sole ſeems greater, and the Foot longer. If theſe ſigns be manifeſt, the Luxation is perfect; if they are obſcure, it is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is not difficult, if due Extenſion be uſed; with the Hands, if the Luxation be freſh, and in a Child, one Servant muſt take hold of the Foot, another of the Leg above the Ankle; and the Chirurgeon muſt force it unto the oppoſite part. If good Extenſion cannot be made by the Hands, we uſe Girts, to the Foot, and to the Leg above the Ankle; about the ſmall. If very violent Extenſion be required, we may uſe the <hi>Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Hippucratis;</hi> or <hi>Paulus</hi> his way, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 121. which is, to drive a ſtake deep into the ground; then to lay the Patient on his Back, aſtride the ſtake, which muſt be driven in ſo deep and firm, as not to give way, when Extenſion is made.</p>
                     <p>When the Joynt is reduced, the Patient muſt be kept longer in Bed, than for other Luxations, <hi>viz.</hi> Forty days; becauſe the Ankle ſupports the whole Body, and therefore unleſs it be compleatly reſtored, that is, unleſs the lax Ligaments and diſtended Muſcles acquire their priſtine ſtrength, the Patients do either relapſe into the ſame Luxation upon every ſlight occaſion; or they find their Foot very weak for a long time. We muſt therefore uſe aftringent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, mixt with whites of Eggs, applied about the Joynt with Tow. If there be pain, then Lenients are required.</p>
                     <p>The Bones of the <hi>Pedium</hi> and <hi>Tarſus</hi> are ſo ſtrongly knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they never ſuffer Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Toes are ſeldom lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, becauſe they are held by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong Ligaments and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. They are reduced as the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>

                     <p>The fieſt preternatural Unition, that I ſhall treat of, is of the Tongue to the parts under it, when the Membranous Ligament or <hi>Frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which connects it, is either too ſhort, or extended to the tip of the Tongue: Then Children are ſaid to be Tongue-tied.

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:52816:273"/>Midwives, who always wear one of their Nails of a great length and being thus ready with an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſtrument in their hand, wherever they come to do their office, they cut the new born Child's Tongue, and unleſs they did this, they believe the Children could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak: As if Nature (O ſtrange ignorance!) could not make a Man ſpeak, which is to perform a proper action, deſigned by her to Man, without the helping hand of a ſilly Woman. <hi>Aquapendent</hi> ſays, he ſaw a new born Child, which was detained a pretty while, till they got the after-burthen away, and it neither cried, nor perhaps was ſenſible of any trouble all the while, till the Midwife cut the <hi>Fraenum</hi> with her Nail, and then indeed it cried, becauſe of the pain. But if this were all, the matter were not great: The worſt is, the Child, when this Chirurgery of the Nail has raiſed an Inflammation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take hold of the Nipple, nor get any Milk, and ſo it dies. And which is yet worſe, they impute the whole cauſe of its Death, either to the Birth, or to its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ability to take hold of the Nipple, or to any thing, rather than to the true, <hi>viz.</hi> the Midwives claw. Let all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therefore, that value their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, have a care, that the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife meddle not with cutting then Tongues. If the Ligament be ſuch as requires cutting, it may be cut in time enough; but this rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens. Becauſe Nature had never deſigned Man to ſpeak, had ſhe not furniſht him with apt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Of many thouſands, that are born with this Ligament, ſearce one requires cutting.</p>
                     <p>But if it ſo happen, that the Tongue is too ſtrait tied, the way to cut it is this; the Patient muſt put his Pongue out beyond his Teeth, then we muſt take hold of it with a <hi>Forceps</hi> (<hi>Celſus</hi> uſes a <hi>Voſella.</hi>) But becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe theſe inſtruments in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who either know not, or are not willing to put out their Tongue; we firſt make them cry, then with a thin cloth between the Thumb and fore-Finger of our left Hand we take hold of the Tongue and draw it out, then we hold it up, or turn it back, that the <hi>Fraenum</hi> may appear: and with our right hand we cut the <hi>Fraenum.</hi> We take an inciſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, a little turning back at the point, then we cut the <hi>Fraenum</hi> tranſverſe twice or thrice, and the parts on each ſide, taking great care, that the veſſels thereabout be not injured, which a Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that has any skill in Anatomy, will not do, becauſe he knows the veſſels under the Tongue.

When he opened the Child's Mouth, and lifted up the Tongue, he found it very thick, but no nervous Ligament under it. Therefore he ſent away the Child, and would not meddle with it. About a Month after, a
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:52816:273"/>Mountebank came that way. The Child was carried to him. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Parents, that the Tongue was tied with a ſtrong, nervous Ligament, and he boldly maintained that, if they would but give him a ſum of Money down, he would make the Child ſpeak in a ſhort time. He got the Money. Then the Impoſtor places the Child in a Womans Lap, and ſlaſhes the Tongue deep before, and on each ſide; as the by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers told <hi>Hildanus.</hi> But the Child, who before could go alone, in the very moment skrieked out and was contracted, ſo that his Knees were drawn to his Belly, and his Hands to his Breaſt. And becauſe of the continued pain, and want of due adminiſtration of Medicines, the Child was extremely waſted and weakned. When <hi>Hildanus</hi> viſited him, his Legs and Arms remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contracted, and if they were by force extended, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drawn back again, and he could not go at all. He ſaid he did recover a little; but does not give account what the final iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of the caſe was. He gives an account alſo of his own Brother, who when he was four years old could not ſpeak a word, and by cutting of the <hi>Fraenum</hi> was able to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>He ſays, the operation has no danger in it, if it be rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and eſpecial care muſt be had, that you cut not too deep; he lifts up the Tongue, and with the point of a pair of Siſſers he ſnips the Ligament in two or three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for ſo it is not ſo apt to grow together again, as when it is cut only in one place. Then he cuts all that is nervous, ſo as not to touch any thing that is fleſhy. If enough be not cut at firſt, or if it grow up again, the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be performed again. when the Ligament is cut, the Nurſe muſt dip her Finger in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes, or common Honey, and raiſe the Tongue gently with it: for thereby agglutination is hindred. This operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be committed to Midwives, who with their Nails do not only tear the Ligament, but the parts adjoyning, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Pain and Inflammation; then Children cannot ſuck, but grow froward, pine away and dye: wherefore we ought to act pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and this operation, thô it ſeem ſlight, ought not altogether to be neglected. And it ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be conſider'd, whether, when the Tongue is ſhort, there be occaſion for cutting or no: for oftentimes upon other occaſions beſides the Ligament under the Tongue, Children cannot form any articulate voice, even when the Tongue is not tied at all, which the preceding caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.</p>

But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the potential, for ſaint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, Women and Children, who had rather venture the worſt, than undergo ſuch terrible means.</p>
                     <p>When you uſe an actual Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the part muſt be defended with ſome Cataplaſm. <hi>Cimolia,</hi> or <hi>Argilla mollis</hi> is the beſt of all.</p>
                     <p>By the potential Cautery it is done thus. Firſt, they boil an Hempen thread in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Lime and Aſhes; then they take it out of the veſſel, and lay it upon a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wetting it with a little of the <hi>Lixivium</hi> for an hour. The thread thus prepared, muſt be laid both on the upper, and under-ſide; in the interflice of the Fingers or Toes that are to be divided. Or the thread may be faſtned to a wooden ring about the Wriſt, to make it keep tight to the part that ſhould be cut, without incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſound parts. This is the way of cutting by a thread.</p>
                     <p>The way of ſeparating by a knife is thus. Firſt, one muſt feel with his Fingers, all along the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, eſpecially in a natural one, whether there be any hardneſs, or ſuſpicion of a Nerve or Vein, which muſt be avoided; afterwards, when the Section is marked with Iule length-ways, it muſt be made above half way towards the Fingers ends, and then the other half, <hi>viz.</hi> from the roots of the Fingers to the place where you begun before. The Knife muſt be long and ſmall. The next thing is, with Liniments and <hi>Diapalma,</hi> to cicatrize the Fingers ſo ſeparated.</p>

                        <hi>CElſus</hi> performs the cure of this by overthwart inciſion, in manner of the Letter X, taking great care, that the Urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage be not violated, which lies near above it. I ſhall give you <hi>Aquapendent's</hi> way, who ſaw and cured an imperforate Maid; and that I may be the more exact in it, I ſhall give it you in his own words.
<q>In the ſpace, ſays he, of ſo many years, <hi>i. e.</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I have been Profeſſor of Phyſick here at <hi>Padua,</hi> I only once ſaw an imperforate Virgin. And no wonder the caſe ſhould be ſo rare, ſince Nature is ſeldom wanting or miſtaken in things neceſſary, becauſe of the many inconveniences and hazards of life which uſually thence enſue. However, this Maid, from the very day of her birth, had the Membrane called <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Alae</hi> were ſo little, that ſcarce any appeared, becauſe they were contracted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the Membrane, and its Tenſion, cauſed by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal repletion: But when the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> was perforated, immediately the <hi>Alae</hi> were formed, as by the Membrane looſed on either ſide. So that from hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, the uſe of theſe <hi>Alae</hi> is to take upon them the defence of the <hi>pudendum muliebre,</hi> which before was otherwiſe guarded by the <hi>Hymen.</hi> This noble Maid was very well till ſhe was Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; but from that age ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ill, which illneſs was occaſioned by the keeping in of her Courſes, which came down then about. She felt great pains about her Loins, and about the bottom of her Belly, which were communicated alſo to her Hips. Which made ſome of her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians treat her as in the Gout, and for the <hi>Sciatica.</hi> Afterward her Body began to pine away, and conſume, ſhe was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feveriſh, and could not ſleep, ſhe had loſt her Stomach, and was at laſt delirous; a hard and painful Tumor aroſe at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of her Belly, in the region of the Womb, and all theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms grew worſe and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, when the time of her <hi>Menſes</hi> approached, At laſt, when ſhe was juſt at death's door, I being called, and having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:52816:275"/>her caſe with my Eyes, I made a ſimple inciſion upon the Membrane, whereupon, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a great quantity of thick, viſcous, aeruginous and foetid Blood iſſuing out, ſhe was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with well, to a miracle. But I made a ſimple inciſion length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the <hi>Vulva</hi> or Sciſſure; leſt, if I had cut <hi>Celſus</hi> his way, tranſverſe in the form of an X, I might have hindred the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Alae,</hi> which reſults from the Lips of the <hi>Hymen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut, looſed on either ſide, and retracted to the place of the <hi>Alae.</hi> And this is the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I uſed with the greateſt ſafety and ſucceſs in a Maid ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, whoſe <hi>Hymen</hi> was not perforate.</q>

When I had made inciſion on the Membrane, thô no Haemorrhage followed, yet I put in a Tent of ſoft Town, dipt in the white of an Egg, mixt with a little Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and applied over it a fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cloth, wet in the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, to aſſwage Pain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the afflux of humors.

<q>Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat.</q> In this Caſe the Chirurgery muſt be adminiured in this manner. The Woman muſt be laid on her Back, her Legs muſt be brought divari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to her Hips; her Arms muſt be brought under her Hams, and tied with convenient bandage to her Neck (as <hi>Paulus Aeg neta</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes) then with a Knite crooked at the point, very ſharp on the edge, but blunt on the back, and a very long handle, Section muſt be made at once or twice; having firſt marked a ſtreight line along the middle of the <hi>Labia,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtrument with the fore-Finger outwardly, and with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Probe before-mentioned, or ſome ſuch inſtrument, inwardly.

At laſt, when he was called to her, he found the Orifice of the Womb quite cloſed up, and the parts extremely ſwelled. under the neck of the Bladder there was a great hole, that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Bladder, at which the Urine dropt out. The cauſe of this ſo grievous an evil had been the Inflammation of the genital parts, not regarded by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Midwife, which was turned to
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:52816:276"/>a putrid Ulcer, which had healed up more by Nature's aſſiſtance, than the Midwife's skill; but the Orifice remained ſhut up. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Clyſters, Fomentations, anodyne Ointments, internal and external Medicines, whereby the pains were aſſwaged, the ſwelling abated, and her ſtrength increaſed: But the mouth of the Womb could by no Art or Induſtry Chirurgical be opened again, ſo that ſhe was ever after incapacitated for her Husband. She lived a long time after, and when he wrote this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſhe had not her <hi>Menſes</hi> the uſual way; but was ſometimes taken with the Gripes and a looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and voided Blood with her Excrements.</p>

Cut croſs ways at right angles, taking heed not to hurt the <hi>Sphincter</hi> Muſcle, as you cut along the appearance of the hole, then put in a pipe of Lead or Silver, armed with ſome cicatrizing Medicament, till the part is cicatrized. In this caſe, thô the place of the <hi>Anus</hi> is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Skin, yet there is ſome ſign of an Orifice, which feels empty, if one touch it. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucaſis l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 79. following <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 81. ſays, it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated with the Midwive's Finger; but it is better to do it with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, as I have propoſed, than to commit ſuch a buſineſs to the virulent claw of an ignorant old Woman; unleſs the Pellicle be ſo thin, that the Chirurgeon may do it with his Finger without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Paulus</hi> mentions the cure of the <hi>Anus</hi> not perforate, through an Ulcer ill cured; But I cannot believe that ever ſuch a caſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; becauſe the <hi>Anus</hi> muſt be opened too often for an Ulcer ever to cloſe it up in healing; becauſe agglutination cannot be made in ſo ſhort a time. Beſides, ſuch a maſs of Humors and Excrements is always flowing thither, that it muſt hinder glutination.

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:52816:276"/>great hazard of its life.

He made an Inciſion, with an inciſion-knife (that the <hi>Sphincter</hi> might not be hurt) wrapt in a linen Cloth: then he put in a <hi>Speculum ani,</hi> and dilated the reſt. The Child preſently diſcharges a great deal of Excrements; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Belly immediately fell, and the reſt of the Symptoms aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                     </argument>
                     <p>MAny parts of Man's Body are of a bad conformation: Some from their birth, others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, either from a Diſeaſe, or from ſome external violence; as from the Rickets and other Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and from a hurt by a fall, blow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The parts affected are the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles, and in them the Nerves and Tendons eſpecially; or the Bone.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a Diſtortion are ſo manifeſt to the Eye and Touch, that I need not mention any; however, it is good to obſerve rickety and morbid Diſtortions, when they firſt ariſe: for then they may with the greateſt eaſe be rectified, eſpecially when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is young, and conſequently the parts more flexible to a healing Hand.</p>
                     <p>As for the cure of Diſtortions; ſuch as come from wounds in the Muſcles and their Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, depend upon the right heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Wounds; and ſuch as come from Fractures, or Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, depend upon the proper reduction of thoſe Fractures and

For <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> ſays, he obſerved it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as others, that Wine, even outwardly applied, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Nerves. When there is an Atrophy in the part, <hi>Succus lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricorum</hi> is beſt, of which take this account. <hi>Johannes Wierus in tract. de Scorbuto</hi> takes fat Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms out of a Churchyard, theſe he waſhes firſt in water, then in Wine very well, he ſhreds them ſmall, and puts them in a Glaſs covered with Paſte, he bakes them in an Oven with Bread, when the Glaſs is cold he ſets it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and when the Paſte grows ſoft, and parts from the Glaſs, the Worms are found diſſolved into Liquor. This Liquor ſtrained muſt be preſerved for uſe, but it muſt be renewed every other day: for it quickly corrupts, eſpecially in Summer time. <hi>Nicolaus de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri</hi> prepares this Liquor the ſame way, only he adds a little Oil Olive to the Worms. <hi>Coſmas Slotanus</hi> took theſe Worms, cleanſed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, put them in a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and poured to them a good quantity of Oyl of Sweet Almonds and Violets, then he diſſolved them into Liquor upon Embers, which after ſtrong expreſſion he uſed. This laſt compoſition ſeems to me the beſt, becauſe ſo the Virtue both of the Oyl and the Worms is kept entire. The juyce of the Worms by its proper and peculiar virtue penetrates immediately, and paſſes to the Nerves, and all that is nervous, and therefore to the Veins and Arteries, whoſe coats conſiſt of a nervous ſubſtance; and this juice ſtrengthens, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and moderately heats theſe parts, by removing the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are there. Beſides, in this compoſition there is a viſcous quality from the Oyls, by means whereof, as ſoon as the juice has penetrated, the Oyls ſhut the Pores, and ſo the innate heat is kept in, and as it were pent up, in the part affected. But before theſe things are uſed, univerſals, as Purging, Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to cleanſe the Body, muſt firſt be uſed. Yet when all is done, the whole ſtreſs of the Cure lies upon the right contrivance, making, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Inſtruments. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                        <q>The Fifth day I applied an Inſtrument, and began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to draw the Fingers to their natural ſite. It was made of a Splint three Inches broad, long enough to reach almoſt from the Elbow to the Wriſt. At the end next the Wriſt, it had a ſtick faſtned acroſs it with four round pegs ſtanding up. The Splint was tied in two places round the Arm with a ſtring. The Inſtrument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being tied on, and well guarded with Lint and Cotton, I put Finger-ſtalls of Leather upon the ends of the Fingers, with ſtrings faſtned to them. Then I drew the ſtrings tight, and faſtned them to the four pegs afore-mentioned: And every day I bent them more and more. And that I might the better do it; I anointed the Arm and Hand with the foreſaid Unguent, as oft as I dreſſed the Wounds. But, that the Fingers might not grow together again, I put Plates of Lead between the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Thus by little and little the Fingers were reduced to to their natural ſite.

Then an Inſtrument muſt be fixt to it, well guarded with Tow, Cotton, or Lint, which muſt be kept on night and day, and as you think good, or as the Patient can bear it, it muſt be extended. But every, or every other day the Inſtrument muſt be taken off, the Limb muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and the Plaſter alſo muſt be renewed. By means of this Inſtrument, the crooked Limb muſt be exterded; but gently, leſt Pain and bad Symptoms ariſe. For all violence is dangerous. In the mean time, while the Inſtrument is fixt to the Knee, the Patient muſt walk gently upon it, if he be in any meaſure able. But if the Arm be crooked, then he muſt ſtie it ſometimes forward, and ſometimes backward. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Inſtrument is thus. There muſt be a wooden caſe, or cradle made hollow, and fit to receive the Thigh about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the ſmall of the Leg a little above the Ankle. Then there muſt be an Iron hoop fit to receive the Knee, with an hinge to open and ſhut, that it may let the Knee in, and with a Button, and ſeveral holes to ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or widen, as there ſhall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Then a male Skrew muſt be put through a hole in the hoop, juſt in the Ham, and a hole in the wooden Cradle which is placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and faſtned with ſtrings to the mid Thigh, and the ſmall of the Leg. This male Skrew muſt reſt by a Shoulder in the Hoop, then the female Skrew muſt skrew on behind the wooden Cradle, by turning of which the Hoop is brought to the Cradle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Leg extended as much as the Chirurgeon ſhall deſire. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> ſays, that without the help of this Inſtrument he has reduced ſeveral crooked Elbows in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following. He ordered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the foreſaid Emollients, that the Patient ſhould every hour take ſome heavy things in his hand, as a Kettle full of ſtones, and walk about with it. Though this be an eaſie remedy, yet he would not have it neglected, becauſe he has found the great ſucceſs of it.</p>

                        <p>The Cure of a diſtorted Foot.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HIldanus, Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 90. has an obſervation of the Cure of a diſtorted Foot, which may ſerve as a pattern in the like caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> A Woman big with Child, as ſhe was going in Pattens, ſtumbled, and was diſturbed, and out of order at it. She was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought to bed of a Boy, whoſe right Foot was ſo Diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Toes, and all his Foot turned inwards towards the inſide of his Ankle. So that when he walked, he trode more upon the out-part of his Ankle, than the ſole of his Foot. Many means had been uſed by excellent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Chirurgeons, but all in vain. When he was above three years old, and all hope of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was paſt, they wrote to me, and begged that I would uſe my utmoſt diligence and skill about the Child. When I had viewed and conſidered the caſe well (to ſpeak the truth) I deſpaired of reſtoring the Foot, the Diſtortion being now old and confirmed. However, at the Parents entreaty, I attempted the Cure in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, becauſe the Child was luſty and fat, I purged his Body with <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Syrupus Roſarum ſolutivus</hi> by turns, leſt by Bathings and Fomentations I might draw the ſuperfluous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to the part affected.

<pb n="532" facs="tcp:52816:280"/>Olei Roſacei, ſi opus fuerit.</hi> This Plaſter wonderfully mollifies and ſtrengthens the nervous parts.</p>
                     <p>The Foot being in this manner ſufficiently mollified, I left off E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollients, and applied Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time while I uſed Emollients. I applied a <hi>Serpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum</hi> or Boot, hereafter deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, althô the Foot was wonderfully diſtorted; yet after the uſe of Emollients, it was eaſily reduced into the natural form, and that without pain: but as ſoon as ever the hand was off it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to its former monſtrous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                     <p>And whenever I extended the Foot (which I took ſpecial notice of) and reduced it to its natural poſture, I felt a great hollowneſs between the inner Ankle and the ſole of the Foot. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the lower <hi>Appendix</hi> of the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> which makes the inner Ankle, becauſe it had reſted a long time upon the <hi>Os calcis,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and ſtood at a diſtance from the <hi>Os calcis.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>Fibula,</hi> which makes the outer Ankle, was preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prominent, and twined the whole Foot inward.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to reduce the Foot to its natural poſture and form, it was neceſſary to depreſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the <hi>Fibula,</hi> and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to prolong the defect of the Proceſs of the <hi>Appendix</hi> of the <hi>Os tibiae.</hi> That was done by Art and Induſtry; this by the benefit of Nature. And that Nature is wonderfully ſollicitous for the maintaining her <hi>Individuum;</hi> I can viſibly demonſtrate by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in my Study. For there I have the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of a Capon, in which the wonderful providence of the Creator may be obſerved. This Creature had broke its left Thigh-bone ſhort off, and the one end of the broken Bone grew over the other by a firm <hi>Calius,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Leg muſt have been ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other: but provident and wiſe Nature made the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> of that Leg ſo much longer than the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> of the right, as the left Thigh-bone was ſhorter than the right; and thus no inequality or deformity was left. And if it was thus in Brutes, why not ſo in Children, while they are growing; eſpecially if they be of a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, as this Patient was? But to return to him; the Foot being thus ſufficiently mollified, I was to think of ſomething elſe. I then therfore anointed the Foot and all the Leg with <hi>Succus Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricorum, aqua Betonicae, ivae Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticae, Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:52816:280"/>not get back into its former prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural poſture, unleſs the ſwathes and bandage happened to be looſe. The Inſtrument was made thus of Iron; it was ſhaped like half a Boot, but parted about the mid Leg, and held together by two pins of Iron running into two Loops, and a Skrew between them, to let the lower part down, or to draw it up right, as there ſhould be occaſion. This lower part was ſo made, as to take hold of the Foot, and keep it from ſtarting any way out of its proper place. This was for the outſide of the Leg. It was faſtened to a piece above the Knee by a pin to run on, for the motion of the Knee. The inſide of the Leg was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Splints, lined with Tow or Cotton, and ſo the Inſtrument on the outſide was faſtned round the Leg by ſtrings.</p>
                     <p>The Foot being tied ſtreight and faſt in this manner, the Prominence of the <hi>Fibula</hi> was depreſſed, or at leaſt hindred from ſtarting out. And the Proceſs of the lower <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> of the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> ſince there was an empty place, might grow out, and ſo by degrees fill up the hollowneſs about the inner Ankle. Thus the deformity of the Foot was rectified, ſo that when he walked no deformity appeared.</p>
                     <p>But Cures of this nature require a long time and great care. For violence does no good, it is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's work to correct ſuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, with the aſſiſtance of the Chirurgeon's skill and induſtry. I found this true in the foreſaid Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The caſe was inveterate and deplorable; wherefore he wore the foreſaid Inſtrument a whole year. And I contrived another for him to wear afterwards. For Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are growing, muſt have new ones fitted to them, as they out-grow the old ones.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the former Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, thô expert perſons, could do no good, was not for want of proper Medicines, but for want of <hi>Serperaſtra.</hi> Wherefore in ſuch caſes a Phyſician muſt ſet all his Wits to work to invent apt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without which, the beſt Medicines are uſed to no purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>A Crooked Back moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proceeds from the Rickets, and may, if minded when the Party is young, be cured. But then it muſt be done by Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal means. I ſhall therefore give you <hi>Hildanus</hi> his method of Cure in the following Proceſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Girl of eighteen Months of age, had the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of her Loins beginning to grow in a bunch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When ſome Barhers had for ſeveral Months endeavoured in vain to cure her by Ointments, Baths, and thin plates of Lead, but ſtill the Spine grew more and more into a bunch; at length <hi>Hildanus</hi> was called. He found the third and fourth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins extuberant, as big as a Ducks Egg, which were followed a little by the ſecond and fifth; ſo that the Spine was grown into a huge bunch, eſpecially towards the left Side: which made the left Leg far weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the right. In the Cure he proceeded thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all he chafed the Back, and the whole Thigh and Leg with the water following, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Nerves. ℞ <hi>Aq. Granor.

About the Breaſt it was tied gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt it might have ſtraitned the Ribs or Midriff. But below the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:52816:281"/>baſtard Ribs to the bottom of the Belly, it was tied pretty tight, that the Iron plate might repreſs the extuberant <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> And leſt the Bodice ſhould have ſlipt upwards, two ſtraps an Inch broad, were faſtned on each ſide of the Groin, to go under the <hi>Perinaum,</hi> and to turn up again upon the Buttocks, and ſo were faſtned by ſtraps to the Bodice on each ſide.

                        </gap>herefore be neceſſary to know what Labour is, and the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, together with its different terms.</p>
                     <p>By a Delivery we underſtand ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>an emiſſion or extraction of the Infant, at the full time out of the Womb.</hi> This definition may comprehend as well the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which is accompliſhed by Emiſſion, when the Infant coming in a commodious and uſual Figure, the Womb ſends it forth without extraordinary violence: as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery contrary to Nature, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by manual operation.</p>
                     <p>As to the general differences of Labour, we muſt take notice, that the one is legitimate or natural, the other illegitimate or againſt nature. To come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of each, we ſay, that four conditions muſt abſolutely be found in a Delivery, that it may deſerve to be called Legitimate, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. 1. That it be at the full time. 2. That it be ſpeedy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable accident. 3. That the Child be living. 4. That it comes right in a good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture or ſituation. For if any of theſe four are wanting, the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is againſt Nature; and the more, by how much the more of them are wanting.</p>
                     <p>As to the due time of Labour, moſt Authors aſſert, that Nature hath appointed to all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals a certain limited time of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with young, and bringing them forth; but that Women only, by a particular favour of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have none prefixt, neither for Conceiving, going with Child, nor bringing forth. And as to Conception, 'tis moſt certain that a Woman can conceive at any time, night or day, Winter or Summer, or any other ſeaſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; becauſe ſhe can copulate when ſhe pleaſes, which few other Animals can, who couple but at certain ſeaſons, when they become luſtful. But as to the time they are accuſtomed to go with young, it is no more preciſely determined to them, than to a Woman; for as ſhe may be brought to Bed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th, Month (but for the moſt part in the 9th.) ſo likewiſe, for example, thô the ordinary time for a Bitch to puppy, is the 4th Month, or thereabouts, yet ſome puppy ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſome later. And the uſual time of Ews yeaning their Lambs is at five Months end: yet ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or recede from that ordinary term, according to the ground where they feed, and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpoſition; which happen to all others, as well as to Women. The firſt time that a Child may live when born, is the 7th Month compleat, and it may better from that time till the end of the 9th Month; but as ſoon as that is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſtay it makes afterwards in the Womb, is no way beneficial
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:52816:283"/>to it, becauſe it hath then acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all neceſſary perfection, and ſtrength to reſiſt all outward inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Child born before the 7th Month, cannot live long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its weakneſs. But he that is born in the 8th, may very well live, yea, and more likely than one born in the ſeventh month (which is contrary to the general opinion of the World) becauſe it is more perfect, as I ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate afterwards, where I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſhew the cauſe of this error.</p>
                     <p>The proper figure and ſituation of a Child is thus. It ought to come with the Head firſt, in a ſtreight line, having the Face turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downwards, that is, towards the Mother's Back, the Arms couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along on its Sides, and the Thighs ſtretcht upwards; but any other part that may firſt preſent it ſelf to the Labour, makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and againſt nature; in which caſe there is often great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Mother or Child, and ſometimes to both, if not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and duly helped.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen Women with Child, chiefly of their firſt, perceive any extraordinary pains in their Belly, they immediately ſend for their Midwife, taking it for their Labour; who when ſhe is come, ought to be well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the matter, and careful not to put her in Labour before there is a diſpoſition to it. For many times both the Mother and Child loſe their Lives, when (by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Amnios</hi> and <hi>Chorion</hi>) it is excited before the due time. Thoſe pains, which may be called falſe, are uſually cauſed by a Colick, proceeding from Wind, which come and go griping the whole Belly, without any forcing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or into the Womb, as thoſe do which precede or accompany Labour: And this Colick is diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by warm Clothes applied to the Belly, and a Clyſter or two, by which, true Labour-pains are rather furthered than hindred. A Woman may feel other kind of pains coming from an Emotion, cauſed by the flux of the Belly, which are eaſily known by the frequent Stools that follow.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns preceding a natural Labour few days before are, that the Belly, which before lay high,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:52816:284"/>ſinks down, and hinders a Woman at that time from walking as eaſie as ſhe uſed; and there flows from the Womb ſlimy humors, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Nature to moiſten and ſmooth the paſſage, that its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward oriſice may the more eaſily be dilated, when it is neceſſary; which beginning to open a little at that time, ſuffers that ſlime to flow away, which proceeds from the humors that ſtrain through the thin ſubſtance of the Infants Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and acquires a viſcous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence by the heat of the place, or from the <hi>Proſtatae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſigns accompanying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Labour, (that is, ſhewing, that the Woman is effectively in Labour) are great pains about the region of the Reins and Loins, which coming and reiterating by intervals, anſwer in the bottom of the Belly with congruous Throws. The Face is ſometimes red and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, becauſe the Blood is much heated by the continual endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours a Woman makes to bring forth her Child; as alſo, becauſe that during theſe ſtrong Throws her reſpiration is ever intercepted; for which reaſon much Blood hath recourſe to her Face. Her privy parts are ſwelled, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Head (lying in the birth) often th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uſts and cauſes the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts to diſtend outwards, which thence appear ſwelled in this manner. She is often ſubject to vomiting, which makes many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, who know not the cauſe of it, that the Women to whom it happens, are in danger: But on the contrary, it is ordinarily a ſign of ſpeedy delivery, becauſe the good pains are then excited and redoubled every moment until the buſineſs be finiſhed. This vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting comes from a Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Womb and Stomach, by reaſon of the ramifications of the Nerves of the ſixth pair of the Brain, which are diſtributed both to the one and the other, and by which it communicates the pain it feels at that time, ariſing from the agitation, which the violent and frequent motions of the Child cauſe, and the ſtrong compreſſion the Muſcles of the lower Belly make during the Throws, for to help the iſſuing forth of the Child. Beſides, when the birth is near, Women are ſometimes troubled with an univerſal trembling, and principally of the Legs and Thighs; not with cold, as at the beginning of an Ague-fit, but with the heat of the whole Body; and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which then flow from the Womb, are often diſcoloured with Blood, which with the ſigns above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, is an infallible mark of the nearneſs of the birth; 'tis that the Midwives uſually call <hi>Shows:</hi> and if one then put up their Finger into the neck of the Womb, they will find the inner Oriſice dilated, at the opening of which, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Infant, containing the Waters, preſent themſelves, and are ſtrongly forced downwards with every pain the Woman hath; at which time one may perceive them to reſiſt, and again preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inger, being by ſo much the more or leſs hard and extended, by how much the pains are ſtronger or weaker. Theſe Membranes with the water in them, when gathered (that is, when they are advanced before the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:52816:284"/>Head of the Child, which makes the Midwives call it <hi>the gathering of the waters</hi>) preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at this inward Orifice, do then reſemble very well to the touch of the Finger, the abortive eggs which have yet no ſhell, but are only covered with a ſimple Membrane: after this, the pains redoubling continually, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are broken by the ſtrong impulſion of the waters, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently flow away, and then the Head of the Child is eaſily felt naked, and preſented at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inner Oriſice of the Womb. Now all theſe, or the greateſt part of them met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at what time ſoever of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans going with Child it be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full time or no, one may be aſſured ſhe will ſoon be delivered; but great care muſt be taken not to haſten her Labour, before the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it be known by theſe ſigns; for that would but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Woman and Child in vain, and put them both in danger of their lives.</p>
                     <p>Labour contrary to Nature is when the Child comes in an ill ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ſituation; as when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents any otherwiſe than the Head firſt; as alſo when the waters flow away a long time before it is born, becauſe it remains dry in the Womb, and they are abſolutely neceſſary to moiſten the paſſage, and render it more ſlippery. When the After-burthen comes firſt, it is an accident, which renders the Labour always dangerous, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great flux of Blood uſually following, of which the Mother may dye in few hours, and the Infant (becauſe it receives no more nouriſhment) is quickly ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Womb, for want of reſpiration, which it then needs, if it ſtay never ſo little after. The Labour is alſo grievous, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Fever, or any other conſiderable diſtemper, which may deſtroy the Child in the Womb; as alſo when pains are ſmall, and come ſlow, with long interval and little profit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which a Woman is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tired: but the difficulty moſt frequent and ordinary comes from the Infants wrong poſture.</p>

                        <p>Of the ſeveral natural ſituations of an Infant in the Mother's Womb, according to the different times of pregnancy.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen we ſhall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the ſeveral natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſituations of an Infant, thoſe contrary to nature, cauſing for the moſt part all ill Labours, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be conceived.</p>
                     <p>It may be conſidered, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Infants, as well Male as Female, are uſually ſituated in the midſt of the Womb; for thô ſometimes a Woman's great Belly is a little higher on the one ſide than the other, yet that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the globe of the Womb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines more that way; and this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation on the ſide muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only in reſpect of the Mother's Belly, and not of her Womb, in the midſt of which it is always placed; becauſe there is but one only Cavity in a Woman's Womb, marked with a ſmall line in its length, without having two or more ſeparations, as is ſeen in thoſe of other Animals.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome who would have theſe two imaginary Cavities to be the cauſe why Women bear Twins, yea, and ſometimes more; and that the Males rather lye on the right, and the Females on the left ſide; which is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his opinion in the 48th. Aphoriſm of his 5th. Book, where he ſays, <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus mares dextrâ uteri parte, fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae ſiniſtrâ magis geſtantur,</hi> but without any certain reaſon for it; becauſe ſome Women have the Males on the left ſide, others the Females on the right; and when there are Twins, ſometimes both are of the ſame Sex, ſometimes not, and indifferently ſituated on the right or the left. This is all can be ſaid in general of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Child in the Womb.</p>
                     <p>But in particular, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeveral figures it makes, it differs according to the different times of pregnancy. For when the Woman is young with Child, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Foetus,</hi> called <hi>Embryo,</hi> is always found of a round figure a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, having the Spine moderately turned inwards, the Thighs folded, and a little raiſed, to which the Legs are ſo joyned, that the Heels touch the Buttocks, the Arms are bending, and the Hands placed upon the Knees, towards which the Head is inclining forwards, ſo that the Chin touches the Breaſt. It reſembles,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:52816:285"/>in this poſture, very well; one ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to void his Excrements, and ſtooping down his Head, to ſee what comes from him. The ſpine of its Back is at that time placed towards the Mothers, the Head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, the Face forwards, and the Feet downwards; and it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by little and little its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which were exactly folded in the firſt Months. It keeps uſually this poſture till the 7th or 8th Month, at which time the Head being grown very big, is carried downwards by its weight, towards the inward Orifice of the Womb, tumbling as it were over its Head, ſo that then the Feet are upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and the Face towards the great Gut; thô ſome <hi>Foetus</hi> never turn before the time of Labour, ſome believe that only Males are ſo turned downwards when they are born, and that the Females are with their Face upwards; but both the one and the other are always turned downwards, with their Face towards the <hi>Rectum</hi> of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is aboveſaid; and when it happens otherwiſe, it is unnatural, for the Child's Face coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will be extremely bruiſed, and the Noſe wholly flatted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardneſs of the <hi>Os pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> in the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>It may be noted that when the Child hath thus changed its firſt ſituation, being not yet accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this laſt, it ſtirs and torments it ſelf ſo much ſometimes, that the Woman, by reaſon of the pain ſhe feels, is apt to believe her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is at hand. And if this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance be well conſidered, we may find it to be the firſt pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed endeavour, which Authors ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Child makes to be bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in the 7th Month, and not being able to accompliſh it, remains for till the 9th, and that reiterating it in the 8th, if it be born, it lives not long, becauſe it was not able to endure two ſuch puiſſant endeavours ſo near together. But it is a meer abuſe, for if the Child turns it ſelf ſo with the Head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or rather is turned, it is but by a natural diſpoſition of the weight of the upper parts of the Body, or by a natural propenſity; and if it ſtirs much at that time and ſoon after, it is not from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be born, but from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience it receives from this new poſture, to which it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuſtomed, as already hath been mentioned. And it begins to turn thus ſometimes from the 7th Month, rarely before but by accident, oftneſt about the 8th Month, and ſometimes in the 9th only; and at other times alſo it turns not at all, as we may eaſily perceive in thoſe that come in their firſt ſituation, that is, with their Feet foremoſt. From whence it is eaſie to conjecture, and I hold it for a certain truth, that the Children are the more ſtrong and robuſt, and conſequently may the more likely live, by how much the nearer they approach to the more natural and perfect time, which is at the end of the 9th. Month.</p>
                     <p>The Infant then is turned on this manner with his Head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the later end of the reckoning, to the end only that he may be the better diſpoſed for his eaſier paſſage into the World at the time of Labour, which is not then far off: For in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:52816:286"/>all its Joynts are eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in coming forth, and the Arms and Legs cannot hinder its birth; becauſe they cannot be bended againſt the inward orifice of the Womb; and the reſt of the Body which is very ſupple, paſſeth very eaſily, after the Head, which is hard and big, being once born.</p>
                     <p>When there are many Children, they ought, if the Labour be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, to come in the ſame figure, as when there is but one: but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by their different motions they do ſo incommode one the other, that moſt commonly one of them preſents wrong at the time of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yea, and before; which is the cauſe that one comes often with the Head, the other with the Feet, or in any other worſe poſture, and ſometimes both come wrong.</p>
                     <p>But however the Infant may be ſituated in the Mother's Belly, or whatſoever faſhion it be that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents at the birth, if it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the poſture above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it is always againſt nature: and the natural ſituation is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a good and legitimate Delivery, that thoſe which are againſt nature, do cauſe for the moſt part bad Labours.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>A Woman's Travel is only many Pains with reiterated Throws, by which ſhe endeavours to bring forth her Child. It is ſo called, becauſe both Mother and Child ſuffer, and take much pains in this action.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as it is known that the Woman is certainly in Labour, by the ſigns preceding, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Labour, before recited; of which the principal are Pains and ſtrong Throws in the Belly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing downwards towards the Womb; and dilatation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Orifice, perceived by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the Finger; as alſo the gathering of the Waters, which come before the Head of the Child, and thruſting down the Membranes which contain them, through which between the pains one may in ſome manner with the Finger diſcover the part which preſents, eſpecially if it be the Head of the Child, by its roundneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Then muſt all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to comfort the Woman in her Labour be got ready; and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to help her, care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that ſhe be not ſtrait laced; a pretty ſtrong Clyſter may be given
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:52816:286"/>her, or more than one, if there be occaſion; which muſt be done at the beginning, and before the Child be too forwards, for afterwards it is very difficult for her to receive them, becauſe the Gut is too much compreſſed: They ſerve to excite it to diſcharge it ſelf of its excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſo the <hi>Rectum</hi> being emptied, there may be more ſpace for the dilatation of the paſſage; as alſo to ſtir up the pains to bear the better downwards, through the endeavours ſhe makes when ſhe is at Stool. And the while all neceſſary things for her Labour ſhould be put in order, as well for the Woman as the Child, a Midwife's Stool, or rather a Pallet-Bed girted, placed cloſe by the fire, if the ſeaſon require it; which Pallet ought to be ſo diſengaged, as to be turned round about, the better to help the Woman when there is occaſion.</p>
                     <p>If the Woman be Plethorick, it may be convenient to bleed her a little; for by this means, her Breaſt being diſengaged, and her Reſpiration free, ſhe will have more ſtrength to bear down her pains, which ſhe may do without danger; becauſe the Child being about that time ready to be born, hath no need of the Mother's Blood for its nouriſhment, which hath been often practiſed with good ſucceſs: Beſides, this evacuation often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her having a Fever after De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. In expectation of which hour ſhe may, walk about her Chamber, if her ſtrength permits; and to preſerve her ſtrength, it will be convenient to give ſome good Gelly Broths, new laid Eggs, or ſome ſpoonfuls of burnt or brewed Wine; from time to time, or a Toaſt dipt in Wine; avoiding at that time ſolid food. Above all, ſhe muſt be perſwaded to hold out her Pains, bearing them down as much as ſhe can, at the inſtant when they take her. The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife muſt from time to time touch the inward Orifice with her Finger, to know whether the waters are ready to break, and whether the birth will ſoon after follow: She muſt likewiſe anoint all the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places with emolientoyls, Hog's greaſe, or freſh Butter, if ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they can hardly be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and all the while ſhe muſt be near her Woman, to obſerve her geſtures diligently, her complaints and pains; for by this they gueſs pretty well how the Labour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth.</p>
                     <p>The Patient may likewiſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals reſt her ſelf on her Bed, for to regain her ſtrength; but not too long, eſpecially little, or ſhort thick Women, for they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways worſe Labours if they lye much on their beds in their Travail (and yet much worſe of their firſt Children) than when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to walk about the Chamber, ſupporting them under their Arms, if neceſſary; for by this means the weight of the Child (the Woman being on her Legs) cauſeth the inward orifice of the Womb to dilate ſooner than in Bed; and her pains to be ſtronger and frequenter, that her Labour be nothing near ſo long.</p>
                     <p>When the waters of the Child are gathered, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived through the Membranes, to preſent themſelves to the inward
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:52816:287"/>Orifice, of the bigneſs of the whole dilatation, the Midwiſe ought to let them break of themſelves, and not as ſome, that are impatient of the long Labour, break them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to haſten their buſineſs, which on the contrary they retard by ſo doing, before the Infant be wholly in the paſſage; for by the too haſty breaking of theſe waters, which ought to ſerve him to ſlide forth with greater facility, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains dry, which hinders after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pains and Throws from being ſo effectual to bring forth the Infant, as elſe they would have been. It is therefore better to let them break of themſelves, and then the Midwife may eaſily feel the Child bare, by the part which firſt preſents, and ſo judge certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether it comes right, that is, with the Head, which ſhe ſhall find hard, big, round and equal; but if it be any other part, ſhe will perceive ſomething inequal and rugged, and hard or ſoft, more or leſs, according to the part it is.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after (that being the right time when all Women ought to be delivered, if Nature perform its office) let her haſten to deliver her Woman, if ſhe be not already, and aſſiſt the Birth, which ordinarily happens ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if natural, and may be done according to the directions in the next Chapter. But if the Child comes wrong, and ſhe be not able to deliver the Woman, as ſhe ought to be, by helping Nature, and ſo ſave both Mother and Child, who both are in danger of their Lives, let her ſend ſpeedily for an expert and dextrous Chirurgeon in the practice, and not delay, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them often do, till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon then as the waters are broke, and the Midwife finds the Child to come wrong, ſhe muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Woman not to forward her pains, leſt by bearing down ſhe engage the Child too far in the paſſage, and ſo give the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon more pains to turn it.</p>

                        <p>Of a natural Labour, and the means of helping a Woman therein, when there is one or more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have already taught, that there are four things requiſite to a truly legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and natural Labour, <hi>viz.</hi> That it be at the full time. That it be ſpeedy, without any ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. That the Child be alive. And that he comes right. All which being found to be ſo, and after the Waters be broke of themſelves, as aboveſaid, let the Woman be preſently placed on a Pallet-Bed, provided for her to this purpoſe near the fire; or ſhe may, if ſhe likes it better, be delivered in her ordinary Bed. For all Women are not accuſtomed to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame poſture: Some will be on their Knees (which is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous way) as many in Country villages; others ſtanding upright leaning with their Elbows on a pillow upon a Table, or the ſide of a Bed; and others lying on a Quilt in the midſt of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the beſt and ſureft way, is to be delivered in their Bed, to ſhun the inconvenience and trouble of being carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hither afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The Bed muſt be ſo made, that the Woman being ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, ſhould lye on her Back upon it, having her Body in a convenient figure, that is, her Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, ſo that ſhe be neither lying nor ſitting; for in this manner ſhe breaths beſt, and will have more ſtrength to help her pains, than if ſhe were otherwiſe, or ſunk down in her Bed. Being in this poſture, ſhe muſt ſpread her Thighs abroad, folding her Legs a little towards her Buttocks, ſomewhat raiſed by a ſmall pillow underneath, to the end that the <hi>Coccyx,</hi> or Rump, ſhould have more liberty to retire back, and have her Feet ſtaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome firm thing; beſides this, let her hold ſome perſons with her hands, that ſhe may the better ſtay her ſelf during her Pains. She being thus placed near the ſide of her Bed (with her Midwife by, the better to help upon occaſion) muſt take courage, and help her Pains the beſt ſhe can, bearing them down when they take her, which ſhe may do by holding her breath, and forcing her ſelf, as much as ſhe can, juſt as when ſhe goes
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:52816:288"/>to ſtool; for by ſuch endeavours, the Diaphragm being ſtrongly thruſt downwards doth force down the Womb and Child in it; in the mean time the Midwife muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, and deſire her to endure her Labour bravely, putting her in hopes of a ſpeedy Delivery. Some would have another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at that time to preſs the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior parts of her Belly, and ſo thruſt gently the Child downwards; but I am not of their opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch compreſſions will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt than profit, by endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bruiſing of the Womb, which is extreme ſore at that time. But the Midwife may content her ſelf only (having neither Ring nor Bracelet on, and her Hand anointed with Oil or freſh Butter) to dilate gently the inward orifice of the Womb, putting her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends into its entry, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one from the other, when the pains take her, thus endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to forward the Child, and thruſting by little and little the ſides of the Orifice, towards the hinder part of the Child's Head, anointing theſe parts alſo with freſh Butter, if it be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>When the Infant's Head begins to advance into this inward ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, 'tis commonly ſaid it is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it girds and ſurrounds it, juſt as a Crown; and when it is ſo far, that the extremity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to appear manifeſtly without the privy parts, it is then ſaid, the Child is in the paſſage, and the Woman in Travail imagines (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô untruly, and it may be is not ſo much as touched by her) that her Midwife hurts her with her Fingers, finding her ſelf as it were ſcratched and pricked with pins in thoſe parts, becauſe of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtention, and ſometimes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, which the bigneſs of the Child's Head cauſeth there.</p>
                     <p>When things are in this poſture, the Midwife muſt ſeat her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to receive the Child, which will ſoon come, and with her fingers ends, her Nails being cloſe pared, endeavour to thruſt (as aboveſaid) this crowning of the Womb back over the Head of the Child, and as ſoon as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as the Ears, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, ſhe may take hold of the two ſides with her two hands, that when the pain comes, ſhe may quickly draw forth the Child, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care that the Navel-ſtring be not then entangled about the Neck, or any other part, leſt thereby the After-burthen be pulled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and poſſibly the Womb al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to which it is faſtned, and ſo cauſe Flooding; or elſe break the ſtring, whereby the Woman may come to be more difficultly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. It muſt alſo be obſerved, that the Head be not drawn forth ſtreight, but ſhaking it a little from one ſide to the other, that the Shoulders may the ſooner and eaſier take its place, immediately after it be paſt, which muſt be done without loſing any time, leſt the Head being paſt, the Child be ſtopt there by the bigneſs and largeneſs of the Shoulders, and be in danger of being ſtrangled in the paſſage: But as ſoon as the Head is born, if there be need, ſhe may ſlide in her ſingers under the Arm-pits, and the reſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will follow without any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <pb n="549" facs="tcp:52816:288"/>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Midwife has in this manner drawn forth the Child, ſhe muſt put it on one ſide, left the Blood and Waters, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low immediately after, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode it, or, it may be, choak it, by running into its Mouth or Noſe, as it would do, if it were laid on the Back. After which there remains nothing but to free her from the After-burthen, which I will ſhew how in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But before that, let her be very careful to examine, whether there be no more Children in the Womb; for it happens very often that there are two, and ſometimes more, which ſhe may eaſily know, by the continuance of the pains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Child is born, and the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Mother's Belly; beſides this, ſhe may be very ſure of it, if ſhe puts her hand up the entry of the Womb, and finds there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther water gathering, and a Child in it preſenting to the paſſage: If it be ſo, ſhe muſt have a care not to go about to fetch the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, till the Woman be delivered of all her Children, if ſhe have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many: For if Twins be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſame Burthen, to which there are faſtned as many ſtrings and diſtinct Membranes, as there are Children; and if one ſhould go to draw it forth as ſoon as the firſt is born, the reſt would be in danger of their lives, becauſe that part is very neceſſary to them, while they are in the Womb; and beſides, it endangers Flooding. Wherefore the firſt ſtring muſt be cut, being firſt tied with a thread three or four double, as we ſhall ſhew more exactly hereafter, and faſten the other end with a ſtring to the Womans Thigh, not ſo much for fear that the ſtring ſhould enter again into the Womb, as to prevent the inconvenience it may cauſe to the Woman by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between her Thighs; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Child being removed, they muſt take care to deliver her of the reſt, obſerving all the ſame circumſtances as was to the firſt; which being done, it will be then convenient to fetch the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, as we ſhall ſhew in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter.</p>

                     <p>MOſt Animals when they have brought forth their young, caſt forth nothing elſe but ſome waters, and the Membranes which contained them; but Women have an After-birth, of which after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they muſt be delivered, as of a thing uſeleſs and inconvenient: Wherefore as ſoon as the Child is born, before they do ſo much as tie or cut the Navel-ſtring, leſt the Womb cloſe, they muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing time, free the Woman from this fleſhy maſs, which was deſtined to furniſh the Infant with Blood for its nouriſhment, whilſt it was in the Womb, and which at that time is called with much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>After-birth,</hi> becauſe it follows the Child, and is to the Woman like another Birth; for being brought forth, ſhe is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered.</p>
                     <p>To perform this, the Midwife having taken the ſtring, muſt wind it once or twice about one or two of her Fingers of her left Hand joyned together, the better to hold it, with which the may then draw it moderately, and with the right Hand ſhe may only take a ſingle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>old of it above the left, near the Privities, drawing likewiſe with that very gently, reſting the while the Fore-Finger of the ſame hand extended and ſtretched forth along the ſtring towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Vagina;</hi> always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving for the more facility, to draw it from the ſide where the Burthen cleaves leaſt, for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt will ſeparate the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; juſt as we ſee a Card, which is glewed to any thing, is better ſeparated from the place where it begins to part, than where it is cloſe joyned.</p>
                     <p>Above all things, care muſt be taken, that it be not drawn forth with too much violence, leſt by breaking the ſtring near the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as ſometimes happens, you be obliged to put up the whole Hand into the Womb, to deliver the Woman; or that the Womb, to which this Burthen is ſometimes very ſtrongly faſtned, be not drawn forth with it: As alſo in drawing it forth with too much violence, there may happen a very great Flooding, which would be of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence: Wherefore for theſe reaſons, it muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhaken, and gently drawn forth by little and little, after the manner we have juſt now deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and to facilitate the better its expulſion, the Woman may
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:52816:289"/>blow ſtrongly the whilſt into her Hands ſhut, juſt as one would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth of a bottle to know whether it be broke; or ſhe may put her Finger into her Throat, as if ſhe would excite vomiting; or elſe ſtrive as if ſhe were going to ſtool, bearing always down, and holding her breath, as ſhe did to bring forth her Child: All theſe motions and different agitations produce the ſame effect, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and expell the After-birth out of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>When all theſe circumſtances have been obſerved, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you meet with difficulty, you may, if need be, after that you know on which ſide the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth is ſituated, command an experienced Nurſe-keeper to preſs the Belly lightly with the flat of her Hand, directing it gently down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by way of friction, above all, being careful not to do it too boiſterouſly. But if all this be in vain, then muſt the Hand be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected into the Womb, to looſen and ſeparate it in the manner here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after-mentioned, where we ſhew the way how to draw it forth when the ſtring is broke.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Woman is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of both Child and Burthen, it muſt then be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be all, and care be had that not the leaſt part of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind, not ſo much as the skirts or any clods of Blood, which ought all to be brought away with the firſt; for otherwiſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they cauſe gréat pains: All which being done, things fit for Mother and Child in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be provided.</p>
                     <p>When a Woman has two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhe muſt be delivered in the ſame manner as if ſhe had but one; obſerving only for the reaſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the precedent Chapter, not to fetch the Burthen, till the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be born; and then it may be done without danger, ſhaking and drawing it always gently, ſometimes by one ſtring, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other, and ſometimes by both together, and ſo by turns till it come, proceeding in it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the directions already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>When the Infant comes right and naturally, the Woman is brought to Bed, and delivered with little help, obſerving what hath been taught in the two laſt Chapters, of which the meaneſt Midwives are capable, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of them, a ſimple Nurſe-keeper may ſupply that place: But when it is a wrong Labour, there is a greater myſtery belongs to it; for then the skill and prudence of a Chirurgeon is for the moſt part requiſite, which we intend now to treat of.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of laborious and difficult Labours, and thoſe againſt Nature, their cauſes and differences, together with the means to remedy them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the eaſier and better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining theſe things, we ſay, that there are three ſorts of bad Labours; to wit, the painful or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious; the difficult; and that which is altogether contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The laborious is a bad Labour, in which the Mother and Child (though it comes right) ſuffer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, and are haraſſed more than ordinary.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the firſt; but beſides, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome accident which retards it, and cauſeth the difficulty: But the wrong Labour, or that againſt Nature, is cauſed by the bad ſituation of the Child, and can never be helped but by manual operation, or the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Hand. In the laborious and difficult Labours Nature always does the work, being a little aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but in that contrary to Nature, all its endeavours are vain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and then there is no help but in an expert Chirurgeon, without whom ſhe muſt certainly periſh.</p>
                     <p>The difficulties of Labour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from Mother, Child, or both.</p>
                     <p>From the Mother, by reaſon of the indiſpoſition of her Body; or it may be from ſome particular part only, and chiefly the Womb: or alſo from ſome ſtrong paſſion of the Mind, with which ſhe was before poſſeſt.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect of her Body, either becauſe ſhe may be too young, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the paſſages too ſtrait, or too old of her firſt Child; becauſe her parts are too dry, and hard, and cannot be ſo eaſily dilated, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens alſo to them which are too lean. They who are either ſmall, ſhort, or miſhapen, as crooked Women, have not a Breaſt ſtrong enough to help their pains, and to bear them down; nor thoſe that are weak, whether naturally, or by accident; and crooked perſons have ſometimes the bones of the paſſage not well ſhaped. They that are teuden and too apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of pain, have more trouble than others, becauſe it hinders them from doing their endeavour: And they likewiſe who have ſmall Pains and ſlow, or have none at all. Great Colicks hinder Labour alſo, by preventing the true Pains. All great and acute Diſeaſes make
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:52816:290"/>it very troubleſome, and of a bad conſequence, according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> 3 <hi>Aph. Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Mulierem gravidam morbo quopiam acuto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripi, lethale.</hi> As when ſhe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a violent Fever, great Flooding, frequent Convulſions, Dyſentery, or any other great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. Excrements retained cauſe much difficulty, as a Stone in the Bladder, or when it is full of Urine, without being able to void it; or when the great Gut is repleted with hard Ordure, or the Woman troubled with great and painful Piles, and their ill ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſometimes retard it extremely.</p>
                     <p>As touching the difficulty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Womb only, it muſt be either be from its bad ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation or conformation, having its Neck too ſtrait, hard or callous, whether naturally, or by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as having had there a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Apoſteme, Ulcer or ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleſh whether on the Neck or inward Orifice; or becauſe of any cicatrice cauſed by a preceding bad Travail.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>les, thoſe things which are or may be contained in the Womb with the Child, do alſo cauſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Travail; as when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are ſo ſtrong, that they cannot be broken, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hinders them from advancing into the paſſage; or ſo tender, that the waters break too ſoon, for then the Womb remains dry. When there is a Mole, or the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-burthen comes firſt, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cauſes Flooding, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the death of the Infant, if the Woman be not preſently delivered of them by Nature or Art; yea, and when the Navel-ſtring comes firſt, the Child is ſuffocated, if not ſpeedily born; ſtrong paſſions of the Mind do likewiſe contribute much to it, as fear, ſorrow, and others of the like nature. The Woman that miſcarries has more pain than a Woman at her full time; as alſo than one that is hurt, althô ſhe be very near her time.</p>
                     <p>As to the hindrances cauſed by the Infant, they are, when either its Head or whole Body are too large, when the Belly is Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; when it is monſtrous, having two Heads, or being joyned to another Child, Mole, or any other ſtrange thing; when it is dead, or ſo weak, that it contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to its Birth; when it comes wrong, or when there are two or more: beſides all theſe different difficulties of Labour, there is yet one cauſed by the Midwife's ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, who for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her buſineſs, inſtead of helping, hinders Nature in her work.</p>
                     <p>Let us now treat of the means, by which all theſe may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Woman ſuccored in her bad and difficult Labour, as may eaſily be done, if we perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know all theſe cauſes and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; as when it happens by the Mother's being too young and too ſtrait, ſhe muſt be gently treated, and the paſſages anointed with Oil, Greaſe, and freſh Butter, uſing theſe things a long time before the hour of Labour, to relax and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them the eaſier, leſt there ſhould happen a rupture in any part, when the Child is born; for ſometimes there happens a dilace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Fundament, by which both are rent into one outwardly.
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:52816:291"/>If a Woman be in years of her firſt Child, let her lower parts be likewiſe anointed, to mollifie the inward Orifice, and the <hi>Vagina</hi> or neck of the Womb, which being more hard and callous, do not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily yield to the neceſſary diſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Labour; which is the cauſe why ſuch Women are longer in Labour than others, and why their Children (being forced againſt the inward Orifice of their Womb, which is, as we ſaid, a little cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and alſo for remaining long in the paſſage) are born with great bumps and bruiſes on their Heads. Small and miſ-ſhapen Women ſhould not be put to Bed, till at leaſt their Waters be broke; but rather kept upright, and walking about the Chamber, if they have ſtrength, being ſupported under their Arms; for in that manner they will breath more freely, and mend their pains better than on the Bed, where they lye all on a heap. Let thoſe that are very lean, alſo moiſten theſe parts with Oyls and Ointment, to make them more ſmooth and ſlippery, that the Head of the Infant and the Womb be not ſo compreſſed and bruiſed by the hardneſs of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Bones, which form the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>The weak Woman ſhould be ſtrengthened, the better to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her Pains, giving her good Gelly Broths, with a little Wine and a Toſt in it; or other good things, as the caſe requires.</p>
                     <p>If ſhe fears the Pains, let her be comforted, aſſuring her, that ſhe will not endure many more, but be ſpeedily delivered: On the contrary, if her Pains be ſlow and ſmall, or none at all, they muſt be provoked by frequent and ſomewhat ſtrong Clyſters, that ſo they may be excited by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at ſtool; and afterwards let her walk about her Chamber, that the weight of the Child may alſo help a little. If the Woman Floods, or hath Convulſions (which is by many too long neglected) ſhe muſt be helped by a ſpeedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. If ſhe be coſtive, let her uſe Clyſters, which likewiſe may diſſipate a Colick, at thoſe times very troubleſome, cauſing great and uſeleſs pains, very hurtful, becauſe they fleet to and again through the Belly, without bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, as they ſhould do. If ſhe cannot make water, becauſe the Womb bears too much on the Bladder, let her try, by lifting up her Belly a little, or elſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a <hi>Catheter</hi> into her Bladder to draw forth her Urine.</p>
                     <p>If the difficulty or flowneſs of the Labour comes from the ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Woman, let her be placed in a better, more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to her habit and ſtature. If ſhe be taken with any diſtemper, ſhe muſt be treated for it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its nature, with more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than at another time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always regard to her preſent condition. If it proceed only from the indiſpoſitions of the Womb, or from its oblique ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt be remedied as well as can be, by the placing of her Body accordingly. If it be by its vitious conformation, having the Neck too hard, and too callous, and too ſtrait, it muſt be anointed with Oils and Ointments, as above directed.</p>
                     <pb n="555" facs="tcp:52816:291"/>
                     <p>If it come from a ſtrong Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, which cannot be mollified, of a preceding Ulcer, or a rupture of a former bad Labour ſo agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated, it muſt be ſeparated with a fit inſtrument, leſt another La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration happen in a new place, and leave the Woman in a worſe condition than before; it muſt be made in that place, where the caſe moſt requires it; taking care that it be not upwards, becauſe of the Bladder. If the Membranes be ſo ſtrong, as that the waters do not break in due time, they may be broken with the Fingers, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Child be come very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the paſſage, and ready to follow preſently after; for otherwiſe there is danger, that by breaking theſe waters too ſoon, the Child will remain dry a long time; and to ſupply that defect, you muſt moiſten the parts with Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Decoctions, and emollient Oils; which can never be ſo well, as when Nature does its own work with the waters and ordinary ſlime, which always happen well, when they come in time and place.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes theſe Membranes with the waters, preſs three or four Fingers breadth out of the Body before the Child, reſembling a Bladder full of water; there is then no great danger to break them, if they be not already; for when it ſo happens, the Child is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow, being in the paſſage; but above all, be careful not to pull it out with your Hand, leſt thereby you looſen, before its time, the After-burthen, to which it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres very ſtrongly. If the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring comes firſt, it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put up again, and kept up, if poſſible; or elſe the Woman muſt be immediately delivered. But if the After-burthen comes firſt, it muſt never be put up again; for being come forth, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs to the Infant, and would be but an obſtacle and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance in the way; if it were put up in this caſe, it muſt be cut off, having tied the Navel-ſtring; and afterwards draw forth the Child as ſoon as may be, leſt it be ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>If the Woman has had a fall, or is hurt, let her immediately keep her Bed and take her reſt. If it be any paſſion that retards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and cannot totally be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, let them endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate it. If it be ſhamefacedneſs or modeſty, the perſons who are the cauſe of it muſt quit the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. If it be timidity and fear of pain, ſhe muſt be adviſed, that it is the will of GOD it ſhould be ſo, and that her Labour will not be ſo bad as ſhe imagines, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her to ſubmit to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, preſſing on her the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unfortunate, whoſe pain always ſeem more ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the conſideration that it is common; ſo ſhe muſt be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that others endure the ſame pain, and greater than hers. If ſhe be melancholick, let her be diverted by ſome good news, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing her ſuch a Child as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. And in a word (thô ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much) ſhe muſt conſider it but as a bad journey, which one quarter of an hours good weather makes one forget all paſt, as ſhe will, when ſhe is brought to Bed; aſſuring her chiefly, that ſhe is in no danger, eſpecially when it is
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:52816:292"/>not very apparent, for then one ought to acquaint her with it, that ſhe may ſettle both her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual Affairs.</p>
                     <p>When the difficulty is only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a dead Child, the method mentioned in the natural Labour muſt be obſerved; and beſides, the Woman muſt do all ſhe can to further her Delivery, becauſe the Child can do nothing, nor can it when it is very weak. She muſt take in the-interim ſome Confortatives to prevent Fainting, becauſe of the putrid Vapors, aſcending from the dead Child. But when it has ſo great a Dropſie, either in the Head or Belly, as that it cannot be born, becauſe of the great diſtention and bigneſs of theſe parts, then we are obliged to open theſe parts to let out the water. And if it be of an enormous bigneſs, either Head or Body, or if it hath two Heads, or is joyned to another Child, or to a big Mole, there is a neceſſity, for to ſave the Mother, either to dilate the paſſage proportionable to the bigneſs of the monſtrous Child, if it be poſſible, or elſe, which is better, to draw forth the Child by pieces, to prevent the Mothers periſhing with the Child, which elſe would certainly happen, if this courſe be not taken. And if there be two Children, the Rules given before in that caſe muſt be obſerved. But if the Midwife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remedy all theſe accidents, ſhe muſt then readily ſend for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chirurgeon, for his advice, or to do what he thinks fit. Let us now paſs to Labours contrary to Nature, which can never be done without manual operation, and ſhew what is then to be done.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of unnatural Labours, where manual Operation is abſolutely neceſſary, and what Obſervations the Chirurgeon muſt make, before he goes about it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THoſe Labours which abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely require manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are, when the Child comes wrong. A Child may come wrong four ſeveral ways, which are; Firſt, any of the fore-parts of the Body. Secondly, any of the hinder parts. Thirdly, either ſide. And Fourthly, the Feet. All the particular, and different wrong poſtures that a Child may preſent, can be reduced to the above-named four general ways, according as they approach more to one than to any other of them. And as the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wrong Births is very great,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:52816:292"/>we ſhall be contented only to treat of each of the principal of them.</p>
                     <p>Now the Chirurgeon (to behave himſelf as he ought) muſt make ſome obſervations, before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes his work. Firſt, whether the Woman has ſtrength enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the operation, which he may gueſs by the Pulſe; if ſtrong or weak, unequal or intermittent. Whether her Face, and chiefly her Eye be dejected, her Speech faint, the extreme parts of her Body cold. Whether ſhe often faints away with cold Sweats, has Convulſions with loſs of Senſe. In ſhort, if every circumſtance perſwades, that the operation would be in vain, 'tis better to let it alone, than ſhe ſhould dye under his hand, and he be blamed for it, and incurr the name of Butcher, as is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when ſuch a misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. However, if there be any hope, thô never ſo little, either for Mother or Child, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Conſcience to do what Art commands, and not as ſome Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who will rather ſuffer a poor Woman to dye without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, than undertake a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation. Wherefore, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to attempt an operation of an incertain conſequence, than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the ſick to certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; for ſometimes Nature reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beyond Hope; but before the Chirurgeon undertakes it, let him give his Prognoſtick, of the great danger of death both Woman and Child is in. When the Woman has ſtrength enough, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt not delay his help, for fear it abate, or be totally diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To which purpoſe, being well aſſured of her ſtrength, he muſt enquire of the Woman, her Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and Friends, whether ſhe be at her full time, or has received any hurt, which he may alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the ſigns, obſerving in what poſture the Child preſents, and what circumſtances, whether alive or dead, and but one or more? All which being examined, he muſt try to perſwade the Woman of the impoſſibility of her being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without his help; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to put her ſelf into his Hands, which he may do by fair words without frighting of her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her that the operation is nothing ſo painful as ſhe may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and in fine, that for GOD's ſake, her own, and her Child's, ſhe is obliged to ſuffer it; for elſe ſhe and her Child may both periſh.</p>
                     <p>The Woman being thus reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he muſt place her croſs the Bed, that he may operate the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, ſhe muſt lye on her Back, with her Hips raiſed a little higher than her Head, or at leaſt, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy equally placed, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put back or turn the Infant, to give it a better poſture; but if he reſolves to draw it forth, he muſt place the Woman ſo as we have directed in the natural Labour, which is, with her Head and Breaſt a little elevated above the reſt of her Body, that ſhe may fetch her breath with more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and help to the excluſion of the Infant by bearing down, when the Chirurgeon bids her. Being thus ſituated, ſhe muſt fold her Legs ſo as her Heels be towards her Buttocks, and her Thighs ſpread, and held ſo by a couple of ſtrong perſons. There muſt be likewiſe others to ſupport her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:52816:293"/>her Arms, that her Body may not ſlide down when the Child is drawn forth, for which ſometimes a great ſtrength is required. The Sheet and Blankets muſt cover her Thighs for decency ſake, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the aſſiſtants, and alſo to prevent her catching cold, the Chirurgeon herein governing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well with reſpect to his own convenience, the facility and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the operation, as to other things.</p>
                     <p>Some would have the Woman bound in this poſture, that (as they ſay) ſhe being more firm and ſtable, the work may be done with greater certainty: but Ligatures are ſo far from that, that on the contrary they are very prejudicial; for the Woman being ſo fixt, and conſtrained as on a Rock, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raiſe her ſelf, nor ſlide down, or be lifted up, when the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon finds occaſion for it, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his operation leſs difficult, which uſually he does by partly putting back, partly drawing forth, ſometimes directly, ſometimes obliquely, for which reaſon her Body ought to be at liberty, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held in a poſture to theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intentions by her Friends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his direction. But if ſhe muſt needs be bound, let it be with good reaſons to perſwade her patiently to endure her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to contribute her whole ſtrength to the operation, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her the ſpeedieſt Delivery poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>Let the Chirurgeon then anoint the entrance of the Womb with Oil or freſh Butter, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſo he may with more eaſe introduce his Hand, which muſt likewiſe be anointed, having the conditions above-ſpecified. After which he muſt manage his operations, after the manner I ſhall direct in each of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters; having firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the marks by which it may be known, whether the Child be alive or dead.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF there be any caſe, wherein a Chirurgeon ought to make the greateſt reflection, and uſe moſt precaution in his Art, it is this, to know whether the Infant in the Womb be allve or dead; for there have been many deplorable examples of Children being drawn forth alive, after they have been thought to have been dead, with both Arms, or ſome other Limb lopt off, and others miſerably kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the uſe of Crochets, which might have been born alive, if they had not been miſtaken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before he reſolve on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of laying the Woman, to avoid the like misfortune, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of being Author of ſuch a pitiful ſpectacle, let him uſe his utmoſt endeavour not to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and to be fully ſatisfied whether the Child be alive or dead; always remembring that in this caſe, timidity is more pardonable than temerity, that is, it is better to be deceived in treating a dead Infant, as if it were alive; than a living one as if it were dead.</p>
                     <p>The Child may be known to be alive, if it be at the full reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if the Woman has received no hurt; if ſhe has had her health well all her going with Child; if ſhe be at preſent in good health, and very ſure ſhe feels it ſtir, which may be known by the Mother's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and the Chirurgeon may be better aſſured of it, if he feels it ſtir himſelf, laying his Hand on the Mother's Belly; to whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he muſt not always truſt. If the Chirurgeon cannot be aſſured by the Infant's motion that it is alive, he may aſſoon as the waters are broke, gently put up his Hand into the Womb, to feel the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Navel-ſtring, which he will find ſtronger, the nearer he feels it to the Infant's Belly; or if he meets with a Hand he may feel the Pulſe, but there pulſation is not ſo ſtrong as in the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, by which it is beſt to be known. If then he finds thus the beating of the Pulſe, he may be confident the Child is alive; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if by putting his Finger into its Mouth, he perceives it to ſtir its Tongue, as if it would ſuck.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary, the Child is dead, if it has not a long time ſtirred; if there flows from the Womb ſtinking and cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humors; if the Woman feels great pains, and a great weight in her Belly; if it be not ſupported, but tumbles always on that ſide as
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:52816:294"/>ſhe lays her ſelf; if ſhe faints, or has Convulſions; if the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring or Secundine has been a good while in the World; or if by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Hand into the Womb, he finds the Child cold, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring without Pulſe, and its Tongue immoveable; and feeling the Head, he finds it very ſoft, chiefly towards the Crown, where likewiſe the Bones are open, and riding the one upon the other at the Sutures, becauſe the Brain ſhrinks, and is without Pulſe when the Child is dead; which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts more in two days in the Womb, than it does in two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is born; which the heat and moiſtneſs of the place do cauſe, the two principles of corruption.</p>
                     <p>But we may only conjecture it, if the Woman has been hurt, or floods much, and be not at her full time; if her water broke four or five days before; if her Breaſts flag; if her Complexion be of a Lead colour, her Countenance lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and dejected; and if her breath ſtinks. We ſay that theſe things may only make us conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it, but not, as the reſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude it; many of which hapning together in one perſon, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that the Child is dead, for want of which it cannot be very certain. Wherefore (as I have ſaid) 'tis good to be very careful before they undertake it, that ſo they may avoid the aboveſaid ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have placed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent way of extracting the After-birth amongſt unnatural Deliveries, becauſe 'tis not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to eſteem it a good Labour, that the Child be well born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs alſo the After-birth be well come away. In reſpect of the Child it may be called Natural; becauſe after his Birth he has no more need of his Burthen; but in reſpect of the Woman it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unnatural. I would therefore firſt treat of this bad Labour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it participates of a natural Labour, in reſpect of the Child, who is in no danger, being born. After that I will come to thoſe in which both Mother and Child are in very great danger, if not ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and skilfully helped.</p>
                     <p>I have already ſhewed, how a Woman muſt be delivered in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Labour, where you may find
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:52816:294"/>the means; but ſometimes the Midwife by endeavouring it, breaks the ſtring with pulling too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or becauſe it is very weak; or elſe ſo putrefied, when the Child is dead, that the leaſt pull breaks it off cloſe to the Burthen, which by that means is left behind in the Womb; or becauſe it cleaves too ſtrongly; or the Woman is weak and cannot expell it, being much tired by a long Labour; or becauſe it was not ſpeedily after Labour drawn forth, the Womb cloſes ſo as leaves it no paſſage, nor can it without much difficulty be again dilated to have it ſetch'd, becauſe it remains dry, after the natural ſlime and humidities, which uſually flow in Labours, are ſometimes paſt.</p>
                     <p>Since it is a verity indubitable, that the After-birth remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind after the Child is born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an uſeleſs maſs, capable of deſtroying the Woman, we muſt take care that it be never leſt, if poſſible. Wherefore having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring it away, and the Navel-ſtring happening to break near the Burthen, you muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the Womb cloſes, introduce your Hand into it, being well anointed with Oil or freſh Butter, your Nails cloſe pared, to ſeparate it from the Womb gently, and draw it forth together with the clods of Blood that are there. When the Navel-ſtring is not broken, it will eaſily conduct the Hand, by following of it to the place where the Burthen is ſituated; but when it is broken, we have no longer this guide; wherefore you muſt be then very careful, that you be not deceived in taking one part for another.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon then as you have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced your Hand into the Womb towards its bottom, you will find the Burthen; which you may know by a great number of little inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are always made there by the roots of the umbilical veſſels, on the ſide where they terminate, which make it to be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Womb; if it yet cleave to it, notwithſtanding that it is then a little wrinkled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even; becauſe its Membranes, which were very much enlarged, contract themſelves immediately after the Child and its waters, which kept them extended, are excluded: But they that are expert in this Art, can eaſily judge of it. If you find the Burthen wholly looſened from the Womb, it will not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to draw it forth, when you have got it in your Hand: But if it cleaves, find out the ſide where it ſticks faſt, and begin there to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it gently, by putting ſome of your Fingers between it and the Womb, continuing by little and little to do ſo, till it be quite looſe; and afterwards draw it out very carefully; obſerving always (if it cannot be otherwiſe) rather to leave ſome part of it behind, than to ſcrape or ſcratch the leaſt part of the Womb, for fear of a Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Inflammation, or Gangrene, which cauſe death; being alſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to draw it forth, till it be wholly or the moſt part of it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, for fear of drawing forth the Womb with it; And preſerve it as whole as the circumſtances will permit, becauſe of ſhewing it to the company, that they may know the operation is well done.</p>

The Woman may likewiſe contribute to this dilatation, as alſo to the excluſion of the Burthen, if ſhe bears ſtrongly down, holding her breath, and exciting her ſelf to vomit, or ſnceze, and do thoſe other things before directed: But if notwithſtanding all this ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not void the After-birth, and if the Womb cannot be dilated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fetch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p>MOſt Authors adviſe, when the Foot, or Feet come firſt, to change the figure, and place the Head ſo, as it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent firſt to the birth; but if they would ſhew how it ſhould be done, we might follow their Counſel; which is very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be performed, if we deſire to avoid the dangers that by ſuch violent endeavors the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Child muſt neceſſarily be put in: Wherefore 'tis better to draw it forth by the Feet, when it comes footling, than to venture a worſe accident by turning it.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon then as the waters are broke, and 'tis known the Child comes thus, and the Womb is open enough to admit the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon's Hand into it, or elſe by anointing the paſſages with Oil or Hogs-greaſe, to endeavor to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it by little and little, uſing to this purpoſe his Fingers, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one from the other after
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:52816:295"/>they are together entred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo to do, till it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently dilated; then, having his nails well pared, and no Rings on his Fingers, his Hands well anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter, as alſo the Woman placed as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready directed, let him introduce his Hand, into the entry of the Womb, where finding the Child's Feet, let him draw it forth in that poſture as we ſhall now direct: But if it preſents but one Foot, he ſhould conſider, whether the right or leſt, and in what faſhion it comes; for theſe reflexions will eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, on what ſide the other may be, which as ſoon as he knows let him ſeek it, and gently draw it forth together with the firſt: But let him be very careful, that this Second be not the Foot of another Child; for if ſo, he may ſooner ſplit both Mother and Children, than draw them forth; which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be prevented, if having ſlided his Hand up the firſt Leg and Thigh to the twiſt, he finds both Thighs joyned together, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending from one and the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which is likewiſe the beſt means to find the other Foot, when it comes but with one.</p>
                     <p>All Authors, for fear of loſing hold of the firſt Foot, adviſe to faſten a Ribband to it with a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knot, that ſo it may not be ſought a ſecond time, when the other is found: but that is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, becauſe uſually when one has hold of one, the other is not far off. They that will may uſe this precaution; but ſuch as are expert, uſe it but ſeldom.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon then as the Chirurgeon has found both the Child's Feet, he may draw them forth, holding them together, he may bring them by little and little in this manner, taking afterwards hold of the Legs and Thighs, as ſoon as he can come at them, and drawing them ſo till the Hips be come forth: the whilſt let him obſerve to wrap the parts in a ſingle Napkin, to the end, that his Hands being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready greaſie, ſlide not on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant's Body, which is very ſlippery, becauſe of the viſcous Humors, which are all over it, and hinder that one cannot take good hold of it; which being done, he may take hold under the Hips ſo to draw it forth, to the beginning of the Breaſt, and then let him on both ſides with his Hand bring down the Arms along the Child's Body, which he may then eaſily find, and be careful that the Belly and Face be downwards, leſt being upwards, the Head be ſtopt by the Chin over the Share-bone; wherefore if it be not ſo, he muſt turn it to that poſture; which is eaſily done, if taking hold on the Body, when the Breaſt and Arms are forth, in the manner we have ſaid, he draws it, with turning it in proportion, on that ſide which it moſt inclines to, till it be as it ſhould be, that is, with the Face downwards; and having brought it to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, let him loſe no time (deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Woman at the ſame time to bear down) that ſo in drawing, the Head at that inſtant may take its place, and not be ſtopt in the paſſage. Some Authors, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this inconvenience, adviſe that one Arm only ſhould be drawn forth, and the other left to prevent the cloſing of the Womb
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:52816:296"/>on the neck of the Child: this reaſon is plauſible, yet if the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon knows how to watch his opportunity, he will not need this ſhift to prevent this accident, which may ſooner happen when one Arm is left above; for beſides that by its bigneſs it would take up ſo much place, which is already too little, cauſing the Head to lean more on one ſide than the other, it will ſtop it certainly on that ſide where there is no Arm.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed ſome Children that have their Head ſo big, that when the whole Body is born, yet that ſtops in the paſſage, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care to prevent it: In this caſe he muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor only to draw forth the Child by the Shoulders, leſt he ſometimes ſeparates the Body from the Head, but he muſt diſengage it by little and little, from the bones in the paſſage, with the Fingers of each Hand, ſliding them on each ſide oppoſite the one to the other, ſometimes above and ſometimes under, until the work be ended, endeavouring to diſpateh it as ſoon as poſſible, leſt the Child be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated; as it will certainly be, if it ſhould remain long in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; which being well and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected, he may ſoon after fetch the After-birth, as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOtwithſtanding all the care poſſible had in the fetching a Child by the Feet; yet ſometimes one meets them ſo putrefied and corrupted, that with the leaſt pull the Body ſeparates from the Head, which remains alone in the Womb, and cannot be extracted, but with difficulty, foraſmuch as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſlippery, by reaſon of the place where it is, and of a round figure, on which no hold can be taken.</p>
                     <p>When then the Infant's Head, ſeparated from, its body, remains alone behind, whether becauſe of putrefaction or otherwiſe, let the Chirurgeon immediately without delay, whilſt the Womb is yet open, direct up his right Hand to find the Mouth of this Head (for then there is no other hold) and having found it, let him put one or two of his Fingers into it, and his Thumb under the Chin, and then by little and little let him draw it, holding it ſo by the jaw; but if that fails, as it often will when putrefied, then let him pull forth his right Hand, and ſlide up
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:52816:296"/>his Leſt, with which he muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Head, and with the right let him take a narrow crotchet, but ſtrong, and with a ſingle branch, which he muſt guide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the inſide of his other Hand, keeping the point of it towards it, for fear of hurting the Womb, and having thus introduced it, let him turn it towards the Head, for to ſtrike it into either an Eye-hole, or the hole of an Ear, or behind the Head, or elſe between the Sutures, as he finds it moſt eaſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and then draw forth the Head ſo faſtned with the crotchet, ſtill helping to conduct it with his left Hand; but when he hath brought it near the paſſage, being ſtrongly faſtned to the crotchet, let him remember to draw forth his Hand, that the paſſage being not filled with it, may be the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and eaſier, keeping ſtill a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or two on the ſide of the Head, the better to diſengage it.</p>
                     <p>You may try for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an expedient (which came lately into my Mind) by which, without doubt, one may effect this painful and laborious operation, without tormenting the Woman ſo much as ſhe is, when either the crotchet or crooked knife are uſed; which is a ſoft fillet, or linen ſlip, of the breadth of four Fingers, and the length of three quarters of an Ell, or thereabouts; then taking the two ends with the left Hand, and the middle with the right, let him ſo put it up with the right, as that it may be beyond the Head to embrace it, as a ſling doth a ſtone, and afterwards drawing the Fillet by the two ends together, it will eaſily be drawn forth, the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let not hindring in the leaſt the paſſage, becauſe it takes up little or no place.</p>
                     <p>But if the Chirurgeon cannot by either of theſe different means draw forth the Head, becauſe 'tis too blg, he will be neceſſitated (if he will finiſh his work) to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it with a crooked knife. For to do this, let him ſlide up his left Hand into the Womb, and with his right guide up the knife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerving that the point be turned towards the inſide of the left Hand, for fear of hurting the Womb; and afterwards let him turn it to the Suture of the Head, and chiefly the Crown, where he muſt make the inciſion with this inſtrument, that having ſeparated ſome pieces, he may the eaſier draw forth the Head, or at leaſt having emptied ſome part of the Brain, by the orifice ſo made, the bigneſs of the Head will be much diminiſhed by it, and conſequently the extraction of it leſs painful.</p>
                     <p>The left Hand, being thus in the Womb, will be very uſeful to help, ſtriking the knife into the Head, for to divide and ſeparate its parts, as the Chirurgeon judges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as alſo to hinder (by inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency) the Womb's receiving hurt; and the right without, for to hold the handle of this inſtrument, which therefore muſt be long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and will ſerve him to move and guide it on which ſide he pleaſes, in turning, thruſting, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſlanting it, as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. <hi>Ambroſe Parey,</hi> and <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now when the Head is thus fetcht out of the Womb, care muſt be taken, that not the leaſt part of it be left behind, as alſo to cleanſe the Woman well of her After-birth, if yet remaining.

To which may be anſwered with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, That if the burthen be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated from the ſides of the Womb, it ought to be firſt brought away, becauſe it may hinder the taking hold of the Head; but if it be ſtill adhering, it muſt not be medled with, till the Head be brought away: For if one ſhould then go about to ſeparate it from the Womb, it would cauſe a Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which would be augmented by the violence of the operation; for the veſſels to which it is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, remain for the moſt part open, as long as the Womb is diſtended, which the Head cauſes whilſt it is retained in it, and cannot cloſe till this ſtrange Body be voided.

                     <p>IF we only reſpect the figure the Child comes in in this Labour, we may ſay it is natural: but when we conſider the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Womb, which is in dauger of coming quite forth of the paſſage; or the extraction of the Infant, we ſhall find it not ſo altogether: for its Head thruſting it forcibly before it, may eaſily cauſe a falling out of the Womb, if the Woman be not skilfully ſuccored in time.

The ſame method we have taught in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Travail muſt not now be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; for in this caſe the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt neither walk, nor ſtand upright; but keep her Bed, with her Body at leaſt equally ſituated, and not raiſed a little, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in a natural Labour. She muſt by no means uſe ſtrong or ſharp Clyſters, leſt they excite to great Throws; neither ſo much humect the Womb, which is already too much relaxed: but to aid her at the moment each pain takes her, when the Child begins to advance its Head, and conſequently tho neck of the Womb, let the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife keep her Hands on each ſide of the Head, to thruſt back by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Womans pains, the Womb only giving way in the mean time for the Child to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, doing the like at every Throw, continuing it till the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her ſelf has forced the Child quite into the World: for one muſt by no means draw it by the Head, as is meationed in the natural Labour, for fear of cauſing the Womb to fall out at the ſame time, to which it is then very apt.</p>
                     <p>If notwithſtanding the Infant having the Head born, it yet ſtops there ſo long as to endanger its ſuffocation; then the Midwife muſt call a ſecond perſon to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to draw it gently forth by the Head, whilſt ſhe keeps back the Womb with both her Hands, to prevent its following the Infant's
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:52816:298"/>Body ſo drawn forth. After the Woman is thus delivered, her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth muſt be fetch'd as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove directed, being ſtill careful for the ſame reaſon, not to ſhake or draw it forth too rudely, and then let it be placed up in its natural ſituation, if it bears down.</p>

                        <p>How to fetch a Child, when coming right it cannot paſs, either becauſe it is too big, or the paſſages cannot be ſufficiently dilated.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are ſome Women, whoſe Children (notwithſtanding they come right) remain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, five, and ſix whole days in the paſſage, and would continue there longer, if they were left alone, without being able to be born, unleſs aſſiſted by Art; to which we are obliged, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have the Mother's life. This happens oftneſt to little Women of their firſt Children, and chiefly, if a little too much in years; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Womb being very dry, cannot be ſo eaſily dilated, as others, who already have had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or are not ſo old. When this happens, after that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon hath done his endeavour to relaxe and dilate the parts, to facilitate the Child's birth, and that he finds all in vain, becauſe the Head is much bigger than it ſhould be, and that beſides it is certainly dead (as it for the moſt part is, when it hath continued four or five days in this condition, after the waters are broke) which he may be more exactly aſſured of by the ſigns already deſcribed: He need then make no ſcruple to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a Crotchet to ſome part of the Child's Head, and rather about the hinder part than any other, to draw it forth by this means direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if poſſible; if not, let him make an inciſion with a ſtreight or little crooked knife, which is beſt, about the Sutures, to empty thence ſome of the Brain, and ſo leſſen the blgneſs of the Head, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after fix his crotchet faſt to the Skull in the ſame place, whereby he will eaſily extract the Infant.</p>
                     <p>It is very certain when the Child is dead, one ought to do according to my direction, to ſave the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life: But it is a very great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether a live Child ought to be ſo dealt with to ſave the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life, after there is no more hope that it can be born any other ways, becauſe of the narrowneſs
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:52816:298"/>of the paſſage, which cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſufficiently dilated for its birth; or, Whether one ought to defer the operation, until there is a perfect aſſurance that 'tis dead? In this caſe I am apt to believe, that, ſince the Infant cannot avoid death, neither one way nor the other (for ſtaying in the paſſage, without being able to be born, it muſt dye, and being drawn forth by crotchets, it is killed) one muſt and ought to fetch it out alive or dead, as ſoon as there is opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it; and when all hope is loſt that it cannot come any other ways, thereby to prevent the Mother's death, which could by no other means be avoided. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (as <hi>Riolanus</hi> very well notes in his 38th Chapter of the 12th Book of his <hi>Anatomical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi>) ſays upon this ſubject,
<q>That it is a neceſſary cruelty, to kill the Child in this caſe, rather than to ſave it from the danger it is in of dying, and ſo certainly cauſe the Mother's death.</q> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this muſt not always be put in practice by the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, but in ſuch an extremity; and then he may do the work as dextrouſly as he can.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen the Child preſents the ſide of the Head, thô it ſeems a natural Labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Head comes firſt, yet 'tis very dangerous both to Child and Mother, for he ſhall ſooner break his Neck, than e're be born in that faſhion; and by how much the Mother's Pains continue to bear him (which is impoſſible, unleſs the Head be firſt right pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) the more the paſſages are ſtopt up. Therefore as ſoon as it is known, the Woman muſt be laid with all ſpeed, leſt the Child advancing further in this vitious poſture, it prove more difficult to thruſt him back, which muſt be done when we would place the Head right in the paſſage, as it truly and naturally ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>For to effect this, place the Woman that her Hips be a little higher than her Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cauſing her to lean a little upon the oppoſite ſide to the Child's ill poſture, then let the Chirurgeon ſlide up his Hand, well anointed with Oil, by the ſide of the Child's Head, to bring it right,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:52816:299"/>gently with his Fingers between the Head and the Womb: but if the Head be ſo engaged, that it cannot be eaſily done that way, he muſt then put his Hand up to its Shoulder, that ſo by thruſting them back a little in the Womb, ſometimes on the one ſide, and ſometimes the other, as he ſees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he may give it a natural and convenient poſition.</p>
                     <p>It were to be wiſhed that the Chirurgeon could put back the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant by the Shoulders with both his Hands in this manner; but the Head does then take up ſo much room, that he has much ado to introduce but one, with which he muſt do his operation, with the help of his Fingers ends of the other Hand put up as far as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Afterwards let him excite and procure the Child's birth, as directed in the natural Labour.</p>
                     <p>At other times a Child comes with the Face firſt, having its Head turned back, in which poſture it is very difficult it ſhould be born: And if it remain ſo long, the Face will be ſo black and blue, and ſwelled, that at firſt ſight it will appear monſtrous; which comes as well by the compreſſion of it in that place, as by the Midwife's Fingers handling of it too rudely, when ſhe would place it in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſture.</p>
                     <p>Now to deliver this Birth, the ſame manner, as when a Child comes with the ſide of the Head, muſt be obſerved, being careful to work gently, to avoid as much as may be the bruiſing of the Child.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Child comes naturally with the Head firſt, becauſe that by the hardneſs and bigneſs of it, the paſſage might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made and opened for the other parts of the Body, which uſually paſs afterwards without pain: but notwithſtanding ſometimes the Head is ſo ſmall, and the Shoulders ſo large, that without a very great difficulty they cannot paſs; which makes the Child often remain in the paſſage after the Head is born. This accident may likewiſehappen ſometimes, having not been careful, but loſing time in drawing forth the Child by the Head, as directed in the diſcourſe of natural Labours, to the end the Shoulders might at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:52816:299"/>ſucceed in the place the Head poſſeſt.</p>
                     <p>When the Chirurgeon meets with this caſe, he muſt ſpeedily deliver the Child out of this priſon, or rather this collar, in which he is caught; for a ſmall delay may there ſtrangle the Child: to avoid which, let him endeavour to cauſe the Shoulders to follow, by gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawing its Head ſometimes by the ſides of it, ſometimes with the Hand under the Chin, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Head, and ſo doing by turns on the one ſide and the other, to facilitate the operation the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being very careful the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring be not entangled about the Neck; as alſo not to draw it forth with too much violence, for fear leſt the Head be pulled from the Shoulders.

                     <p>FOr the moſt part when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant preſents any part of his Body together with the Head, it is uſually one or both the Hands, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its birth; becauſe the Hands take up part of the paſſage, and for the moſt part they cauſe the Head to lean on one ſide.

                     <p>To remedy this, ſo ſoon as it is perceived that one Hand preſents together with the Head, it muſt be prevented from coming down more, or engaging further in the paſſage.

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen an Infant preſents only one or both Hands to the Birth, or an Arm ſometimes out to the Elbow, and many times to the Shoulder, it is one of the worſt and moſt dangerous poſtures a Child can come in, as well for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as for his Mother; becauſe of the violent force the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is oftentimes obliged to uſe both to the one and the other, in ſearching for the Feet, which are very far off, by which he muſt always in theſe caſes, turn and draw him forth; which will often make him ſweat in the midſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe of the difficulty in this Labour more than in all the reſt, thô ſome others of them indeed are more dangerous for the Infant; as when it preſents the Belly, and the Navel-ſtring comes forth; but not ſo painful for the Chirurgeon, becauſe the Feet of the Infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the paſſage, and not ſo hard to be found, as when he comes with a Hand; for then they are high, at the very bottom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Womb, where he muſt ſeek them, to turn it and draw it forth, as I am going to direct.</p>
                     <p>When therefore it preſents with one Hand only, or a whole Arm firſt; it muſt by no means be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth by that part; for the Member will ſooner be ſeparated and rent from the Body, than the Child ſo brought forth, by reaſon the Child is pluckt obliquely and croſs. And when both Arms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if pluckt together, there would not be place for the Head to paſs, which would by that means be turned quite back. Wherefore having placed the Woman as is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, one muſt put back the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant's Hand or Arm, which comes forth into into the Womb again. Some Midwives dip it in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or touch it with a wet cloth, ſaying that the Infant will preſently
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:52816:300"/>draw it in, if he be living; but he is uſually ſo preſt and engaged in the paſſage by this bad poſture, that he has not liberty enough to draw back his Hands ſo eaſily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once come forth; wherefore the Chirurgeon muſt guide them back with his own, which he muſt afterwards ſlide into the Womb under the Child's Breaſt and Belly, ſo far till he finds the Feet, which he muſt gently pull towards him, to turn and draw it forth by them, as hath been already directed; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to do it with as little vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as may be, which is much more eaſy, ſure and ſafe, than to buſie ones ſelf in putting it into a natural ſituation.</p>
                     <p>As foon as he ſhall have ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Child by the Feet, if he has but one of them, he muſt ſearch for the other, that ſo he may bring it to the firſt; when holding them both, he muſt govern himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in bringing the Child, as I have ſhewed formerly, ſpeaking of thoſe Labours where the Feet come firſt: But if the Arm be ſo far advanced (almoſt to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) and big and ſwelled (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when it hath been a long time forth) that it cannot at all, or without great difficulty be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Ambroſe Parey</hi> in this caſe directs (provided the Child be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dead) to cut off that Arm as high as may be, firſt making an inciſion round the fleſh, and then cutting off the Bone a little higher, with a pair of ſharp pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that ſo the fleſh may be left longer to cover the ſharpneſs and end of the Bone, to prevent hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Womb, when the Child is turned, to draw it afterwards forth by the Feet as it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding if the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, not being able to put it back, is abſolutely conſtrained to cut it off (which muſt not be done but in ſuch extremity) he may effect it without much ceremony, by twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it twice or thrice about; for by reaſon of its tenderneſs he will eaſily ſeparate it from the Body, in the joynt of the Shoulder, with the Shoulder-blade, by which means he will neither need Pincers nor other inſtruments to cut the Bone and Fleſh, as the ſaid <hi>Parey</hi> teaches, neither will there remain any ſharpneſs, by reaſon the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will be juſt in the joynt.</p>
                     <p>But above all, when the diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of an Infant is thus intended, or to draw it forth with a Crotchet, let the Chirurgeon take great care that he be not deceived; for what a horrible ſpectacle would it be, to bring a poor Child yet living, after the Arm has been cut off, or any other part of the Body?

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF the Infant preſents both Hands and Feet together at the Birth, it is altogether impoſſible it ſhould be born ſo. The Chirurgeon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore guiding his Hand towards the orifice of the Womb, will perceive nothing but a many ſingers cloſe together; and if it be not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently dilated, he will be a good while before he can exactly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Hands and the Feet, by reaſon they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſhut and preſt together, that they ſeem to be all of one and the ſame ſhape: But when the Womb is open enough to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Hand into it, he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily know which are the Hands and which the Feet; and having well taken notice of it, let him ſlide his Hand, and preſontly direct it towards the Infant's Breaſt, which he will find very near, and by that let him gently thruſt back the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy towards the bottom of the Womb, leaving the Feet in the ſame place where he found them; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore placed the Woman in a convenient poſture, that is, her Hips a little raiſed above her Breaſt and Head, which ſituation ought always to be obſerved, when the Child is to be put back into the Womb: Let him afterwards take hold of him by the Feet, and draw him forth, according to the way directed in its proper Chapter.</p>
                     <p>This Labour truly is a little troubleſome, but nothing near ſo much as that we have mentioned in the preceding Chapter, where the Child preſents only his Hands: for in that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some Authors who have written of Labours, and never practiſed them, do order all by the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept often reiterated, that is, to reduce all wrong Births to a natural Figure; which is, to turn it, that it may come with the Head firſt: But if they themſelves had ever had the leaſt experience, they would know that it is very often impoſſible, at leaſt, if it were to be done by the exceſs of violence,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:52816:301"/>that muſt neceſſarily be uſed to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, it would go near to deſtroy both Mother and Child in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. A <hi>Fiat</hi> in this caſe is ſoon ſaid and ordered; but it is not ſo eaſily executed as pronounced. For my part, I am of an opinion clear contrary to theirs; and ſuch as are skilful in the Art will ſurely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me in it, that is, That (whenſoever the Infant comes wrong in what poſture ſoever from the Shoulders to the Feet) it is the beſt way and ſooneſt done, to draw it forth by the Feet, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, if they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves, rather than to try to put it in a natural poſture, and place the Head foremoſt: for the great endeavors often neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be uſed in turning the Infant in the Womb, do ſo weaken both Mother and Child, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not afterwards ſtrength enough for to commit the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the work of Nature; and uſually the Woman has no more Throws nor Halns fit for Labour after ſhe has been ſo wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for which cauſe it would be very tedious and difficult; as alſo the Infant, which is already very weak, would certainly periſh in the paſſage, without being able to be born. Wherefore it is much better in theſe caſes, immediately to ſetch it by the Feet, ſearching for them, as I have already direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they do not preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by which a tedious Labour will be prevented to the Mother, and the Child will be often brought alive, who without it will ſcarce eſcape death, before he can he brought forth by the ſtrength of Nature.</p>

                        <p>Of a Delivery when the Child comes with Shoulders, Back or Breaſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe moſt difficult of theſe three ſort of Figures and Situations, in which Infants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come, is that of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; becauſe it is furtheſt from the Feet of the Infant, and the Chirurgeon muſt find them to draw it forth. The next the Back. And the Breech for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, cauſes leaſt trouble, not only becauſe the Feet are nearer, but alſo becauſe by this Figure, the Head and Neck of the Infant are not ſo conſtrained and lockt, as in the other ſituations.</p>
                     <p>For to remedy this birth of the Shoulder, ſome adviſe that it ſhould be put back, to make way for the Head of the Infant, that ſo it may be reduced to a natural birth: but it is much better for the reaſons above alledged, to try to bring it by the Feet: to effect which, the Chirurgeon muſt thruſt the Shoulder a little back with his Hand, that ſo he may have more liberty to introduce it into the Womb, and ſliding it then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Child's Body, either by the Belly or Side, as he finds it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt, he ſhall fetch the Feet, and turning it bring them to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſo deliver the Woman, as is already directed.</p>
                     <p>If it be the Back which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the birth, it is alſo impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be born in that poſture, what pains ſoever the Mother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures; and beſides, the Child ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Body folded inwards, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:52816:302"/>almoſt double, his Breaſt and Belly are ſo preſt together, that he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wants little of being ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: to avoid which, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt quickly ſlide up his Hand along the Back towards the inferior parts, until he meets the Feet, to bring it forth the ſame way as if it came footling.</p>
                     <p>But when the Child comes with the Breech, if it be ſmall and the Mother big, having the paſſage very large, he may ſometimes with a little help be born ſo; for thô he comes double, yet the Thighs being folded towards the Belly, which is ſoft and gives way, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without much trouble. As ſoon as the Chirurgeon finds the Child to come with the Buttocks fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he muſt not permit it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage lower in the paſſage; for it will not come, unleſs it be very ſmall, and the paſſage very large, as we have already ſaid. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in good time perceived, he muſt, if he can, thruſt back the Breech, and ſliding up his Hand along the Thighs to the Legs and Feet of the Child, he muſt bring them gently one after the other forth of the Womb, by folding, ſtretching, wagging, and drawing them gently towards the Side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful not to wind them too much, or cauſe a diſlocation; and then let him draw forth the reſt of the Body, as if it came with the Feet foremoſt.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid that the Chirurgeon, perceiving the Child to come with the Breech foremoſt, ought to put it back if he can; for ſometimes he will be advanced ſo forward in the paſſage, that you may ſooner deſtroy both Mother and Child, than reduce it back, when once ſtrongly engaged. When this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, he cannot hinder it from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in this poſture, in which his Belly is ſo preſt, that he often voids the <hi>Meconium</hi> by his Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, he may much help this birth, by ſliding up one or two Fingers of each Hand on each ſide of the Buttocks, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them into the Groins, and having crooked them inward, he muſt draw the Breech juſt out to the Thighs, and then by drawing and wagging it from ſide to ſide, he will diſengage them from the paſſage; as alſo the Feet and Legs one after the other, being careful of diſlocating any part; and then he may extract the reſt as before, when coming with the Feet.</p>

But that which ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the danger much more, is, that for the moſt part the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring comes forth when the Child comes with the Belly. Therefore as ſoon as it is diſcovered to be ſo, the Chirurgeon muſt apply the ſole remedy of drawing it forth by the Feet as ſpeedily as may be in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>Having placed the Woman, let him gently ſlide up his flat Hand (being well anointed for the eaſier entrance) towards the middle of the Child's Breaſt, which he muſt thruſt back to turn it; this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being already half altered, the Feet being as near to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as the Head, when it peſents the middle of the Belly; then he muſt ſlip up his Hand under the Belly, till he ſinds the Feet, which he muſt bring to the paſſage, to draw it forth in the ſame manner as if it had come footling, being careful to keep the Breaſt and Face downwards, which muſt always be obſerved before the Head can be drawn forth, for the reaſons often already given, which muſt never be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>When a Child comes with Breaſt or Belly, the Chirurgeon muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proceed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in both, inaſmuch as they require the ſame circumſtances. An Infant may likewiſe come with the Side, which way it is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to paſs as the two former: but it is not ſo much tormented, nor is the ſituation ſo cruel; for it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in it a longer time without dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in the two former, wherein it is much more racked than in this, in which the Body may be bended forward, and not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:52816:303"/>as in the other; neither does the Navel-ſtring come forth ſo eaſy as when it comes with the Belly firſt. In this, as in the other two Births, the Chirurgeon muſt draw the Child forth by the Feet in this faſhion: having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Woman as ſhe ought to be, he may puſh back a little with his Hand the Infant's Body, the better to introduce it, which he may ſlide along the Thighs, till he finds the Legs and Feet, by which he muſt turn it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards draw it forth, juſt in the ſame manner as before, with the ſame Obſervations. Nor ought he to amuſe himſelf in any of theſe three births, to place the Head right, that it might come natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; becauſe it is in great danger of dying in theſe unnatural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, if not drawn forth with ſpeed; which can never be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs it be by finding the Feet, as I have directed.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF all the unnatural Figures and Situations, which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deſcribed, that a ſingle Child may come in, do cauſe thoſe many difficulties and dangers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſurely the Labour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeveral together come in theſe bad ſituations, muſt be much more painful, not only to the Mother and Children, but to the Chirurgeon alſo; for they are then ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and preſſed, that for the moſt part they trouble each other, and hinder both their births: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Womb is then ſo filled with them, that the Chirurgeon can ſcarce introduce his Hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much violence, which he muſt do, if they are to be turned or thruſt back, to give them a better poſition than wherein they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves.</p>
                     <p>When a Woman has two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they do not ordinarily both preſent to the birth together; but the one is often more forward than the other, which is the cauſe why but one is felt, and that ſometimes it is not diſcovered that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will have twins, till going to fetch the After-birth, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is then perceived.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhewed, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of natural Labours, how a Woman ſhould be delivered of Twins, coming both right: It now remains to direct what ought to be done, when they come ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both wrong, or one of them only, as it is for the moſt part:
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:52816:304"/>the firſt coming right, the ſecond footling, or any other worſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: and then muſt the birth of the firſt be haſtned as much as may be, that ſo there may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently way for the ſecond (which has ſuffered much by this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poſition) to fetch it by the Feet, without trying to place it right, althô it were ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to it; becauſe it has been already ſo tired and weakened; as alſo the Woman by the birth of the firſt, that there would be more danger; that it would ſooner dye, than come of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes when the firſt is born naturally, the ſecond offers the Head likewiſe to the birth: In this caſe 'tis good committing a work ſo well begun, to Nature to finiſh, provided ſhe be not too ſlow; for a Child may dye, althò right, by lying too long in the birth; and the Woman who has been much tormented with bearing the firſt, is uſually ſo tired and diſcouraged, when ſhe thinks that but half her work is over, that ſhe has no more Pains, or very few and ſlow, nor any conſiderable Throws to bear the ſecond, as ſhe had done the firſt. Wherefore if the birth of the ſecond proves tedions, and the Woman grows weaker, let the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon defer it no longer, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Hand gently into the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Above all, the Chirurgeon muſt be careful not to be deceived, when both Children together of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Birth either their Hands or Feet; and muſt well conſider in the operation, whether they be not joyned together, or any other ways monſtrous; as alſo which part belongs to one Child, and which to the other, that ſo they may be fetcht one after the other, and not both together, as would be if it were not duly conſidered, taking the right Foot of the one, and the left of the other, and ſo drawing them together, as if they belonged both to one Body, becauſe there is a right and a left, by which means it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ever to deliver them: but it may eaſily be prevented, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found two or three Feet of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Children preſenting in the paſſage, and taking aſide two of the forwardeſt, a right and a left, and ſliding his Hand along the Legs and Thighs up to the Twiſt, if forwards; or to the Buttocks if backwards, he finds they belong both to one body; being certain of it he may then begin to draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="581" facs="tcp:52816:304"/>firſt put a little aſide that part of the other Child which offers (to have the more way, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the firſt whatever it is, as ſoon as may be) obſerving the ſame Rules, as if there were but one, that is, keeping the Breaſt and Face downwards, with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance directed, where the Child comes Footling; and not fetch the Burthen, till the ſecond Child be born; which if it were looſned from the ſides of the Womb, would cauſe a Flooding, for the reaſons already alledged, that the Orifices of the Veſſels to which it was joyned, would continue open by this ſeparation, as long as the Womb was diſtended by the other Child, yet within it, and never cloſe (as it often happens) till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite emptied of all, it begins to contract it ſelf, and retire, (as a Man may ſay) within it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the Chirurgeon has drawn forth one Child, he muſt ſeparate it from the Burthen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tied and cut the Navel-ſtring, and then fetch the other by the Feet in the ſame manner; and afterwards bring the Burthen with the two ſtrings, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proper place.

                     </argument>
                     <p>AN Infant does not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Belly, when the Navel-ſtring comes firſt: for thô he preſents naturally as to the figure of his Body, that is, with the Head firſt; yet ſometimes the Navel-ſtring falls down, and comes before it: for which cauſe the Child is in much danger of death at leaſt, if the Labour be not very quick, becauſe the Blood (that ought to paſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>epaſs through thoſe veſſels which compoſe it, to nouriſh and enliven the Child, whilſt he continues in the Womby being coagnlated, hinders the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation which ought to be there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ade; which happens as well by the Contuſion, as the Cold thoſe veſſels receive, being much preſſed in the paſſage, when it comes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Head, or any other part; as alſo becauſe the Blood does there coagulate (as is
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:52816:305"/>ſaid) by reaſon of the Cold which it take; by the coming forth of the Navel-ſtring.</p>
                     <p>But thô this accident may cauſe the Infant's ſudden death, 'tis not ſo much for want of nouriſhment, without which he might paſs a day or more, there being Blood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his Body for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but becauſe the Blood can be no longer vivified and renewed by circulation, as it has continual need; which being obſtructed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cauſes the Creature's ſudden death, ſooner or later, according as it is more or leſs obſtructed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe the Woman muſt without any delay be delivered; which if Nature do not ſpeedily perform, the Child muſt be drawn forth by the Feet.</p>
                     <p>Women that have great Waters, and a long ſtring to the Burthen, are very ſubject to this miſchief; for the Waters coming forth in great abundance at the breaking of the Membranes, do often at that inſtant draw the ſtring, which ſwims in the midſt forth, along with them; and much the eaſier, if the Infant's Head be not advanced very forward into the paſſage, to hinder the coming forth of it in this manner.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as 'tis perceived, you muſt immediately endeavour to put it back, to prevent the cooling it, behind the Child's Head, leſt it be bruiſed, as we have already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby the Blood may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate there; keeping it in that place where it was thruſt back, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Head being fully come down into the paſſage, may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the coming down of it again: which may be effected by holding it up with the Fingers of one Hand on that ſide it comes down, until the Head be advanced as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid; or in caſe the Hand be taken away, to put a piece of fine ſoft rag between that ſide of the Head and the Womb, to ſtop up the way it came down by, always leaving an end of the rag without the Body, for to draw it forth by at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe cautions, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting back of it, it will yet come forth every Pain; then without farther delay, the Chirurgeon muſt bring the Child forth by the Feet, which he muſt ſearch for, thô the Infant comes with the Head: for there is but this means to ſave the Child's life, which it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe by the leaſt delay in this caſe. Wherefore having placed the Woman conveniently, let him gently put the Head which offers, back (provided it be not engaged too low among the bones of the paſſage, and that it may be done without too great violence to the Woman; for in that caſe it will be better to let the Child run the hazard of dying, than to deſtroy the Mother) and then ſlide up his Hand well anointed, under the Breaſt and Belly to ſearch for the Feet, by which he muſt draw it forth according to former directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                        <p>Of a Labour wherein the Burthen firſt offers, or firſt comes quite forth.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe coming forth of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring before the Infant, of which we have treated in the foregoing Chapter, is often the cauſe of his death, for the reaſons there given: but the coming firſt of the Burthen, is yet much more dangerous; for beſides that the Children are ordinarily Still-born (if they be not affiſted in the very Inſtant) the Mother likewiſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in very great peril of her life; becauſe of her great Floodings, which uſually happen, when it is looſened from the Womb before its due time, becauſe it leaves all the Orifices of the veſſels open, to which it did cleave, whence flows inceſſantly Blood, until the Child is born: For the Womb, whilſt any thing continues there, does every moment ſtrongly endeavor to expel it, by which means it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually voids and expreſſes the Blood of the Veſſels, which are always open, when the Burthen is ſo ſeparated, as long as the Womb remains extended and cannot be cloſed, until it has voided all that it did contain, and comes by the contraction of its Membranous ſubſtance to ſtop them by preſſing them together. Wherefore if we ought to be vigilant to ſuccor an Infant, when the ſtring comes firſt, we ought much more to be ſo when the Burthen comes forth firſt, and the leaſt delay is ever cauſe of the Infant's ſudden death, if the Woman be not ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, becauſe the Infant cannot ſtay then long in the Womb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffocation, ſtanding then in need of breathing by the Mouth, the Blood being no longer vivified by the preparation made in the Burthen, the uſe and function of which then ceaſes, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it is ſeparated from the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Womb, to which it was joyned; for which reaſon there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows a great Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is ſo dangerous for the Mother, that without ſpeedy help, ſhe ſoon loſes her life by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky accident.</p>
                     <p>When the Burthen is not wholly come forth, but lies in the paſſage, ſome adviſe to put it back before the Child be fetcht; but I am not of that opinion, for when it comes into the paſſage before the Infant, it is then totally divided from the Womb, at the bottom of which
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:52816:306"/>it ought ordinarily to be ſituated and faſtned, until the Child be Born: but becauſe (as ſoon as it is wholly looſned, as it always is when it comes firſt) it becomes a Body altogether unnatural; it muſt never be thruſt back, but on the contrary, be fetcht away, and at the very moment after, bring the Child by the Feet, althô it come naturally with the Head firſt. For what reaſon can there be to put it back, ſince it is of no uſe to the Infant, from the moment it is ſeparated from the Womb? And ſuch a proceeding is ſo far from being uſeful, that this Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then would much hinder the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon from being able to turn the Child as he ought, to bring it by the Feet.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when it preſents in the paſſage, which may be ſoon perceived, if they find every where a ſoft ſubſtance, without the leaſt reſiſtance to the touch of any ſolid part; finding likewiſe the ſtring faſtned to the middle of it, and the Woman Flooding extremely, as is ordinary at ſuch times. Then, inſtead of thruſting it back, the Burthen muſt be brought away, that ſo there may be the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and room to extract the Child, according to former dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>The Burthen being quite looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Womb, and coming firſt in the paſſage, muſt not be thruſt back into it again; much leſs muſt it be put back when it is quite come forth of the Body. Care muſt be only taken, that the ſtring be not cut till the Child is born; not out of hopes of any benefit from it to the Infant during the Delivery, but that ſo much time may not be loſt before the Infant be fetcht, which is then ever in great danger; as alſo the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be the ſooner ſtopt, which happens for the moſt part, as ſoon as the Woman is delivered; for which reaſons it muſt be with all poſſible ſpeed diſpatched.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, notwithſtanding this dangerous accident, the Child may be Born alive, if timely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored: but it is then ſo weak, that it is hard to diſcover, whether it be living or dead.</p>
                     <p>When it ſo happens, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives do ordinarily before they ſeparate the Burthen, put it into a Skellet of hot Wine, and imagine, with no ſmall ſuperſtition, that in caſe it comes to it ſelf, the vapors of the warm Wine was the cauſe of it, being conveyed by means of the ſtring, into the Infant's Belly, and ſo giving it vigor. But it is more credible, that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuffocated for want of Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as ſoon as it needed it, it begins now by means of it to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from that fainting. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there is no hurt in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cuſtome, thô ſuperſtitious, ſince it can do no prejudice, and may ſatisfy preingaged Spirits, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided neceſſaries be not neglected, in being blindly carried away with this conceit.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How to deliver a Woman, when the Child is Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, or Monſtrous.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Child may in the Womb have either the Dropſie of the Head, called <hi>Hydrocephale,</hi> or of the Breaſt, or of the Belly. And when theſe parts are ſo filled with water, that they are much too big for the paſſage through which the Child muſt iſſue; then notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Throws or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, by which the Woman may attempt to bring it forth, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe ſhould effect it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Art; as likewiſe when the Child is Monſtrous, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being only too big in the whole Body, or in any particular part, or by being joyned to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child.</p>
                     <p>If the Child be living that has the Dropſie, when the Woman is in Labour, it muſt be deſtroyed to ſave the Mother, by making a hole in either the Head, Breaſt, or Belly of it, where the Waters are contained, that being emptied by the apertion ſo made, the Child may the eaſier be drawn forth, or elſe he muſt neceſſarily dye in the Womb, not being able to be Born; and remaining there will alſo kill the Mother. Wherefore to ſave her life, the Infant muſt be by an indiſpenſable neceſſity brought forth by Art, ſince 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould come of it ſelf; which may be done with a crooked knife ſharp at the very point, the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon proceeding in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                     <p>After that the Woman is placed conveniently for the operation, he muſt ſlide up his left Hand on the right ſide of the inferior part of the Infant's Head, if the waters be contained therein; which he will perceive by the extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and extent of it; the Sutures much ſeparated, and the Bones of it far diſtant one from the other, by reaſon of the diſtention made by the incloſed waters, of which being very certain, let him ſlide with his right Hand along the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his left his crooked knife, taking care that the point of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n introducing it, be always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his left Hand, for fear of wounding the Womb; and having conducted it cloſe up to the Head, againſt one of the Sutures, let him turn the knife towards it, and make an Apertion large enough to let out the water: And then it will be very eaſie to bring forth the
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:52816:307"/>Child; foraſmuch as the other parts are then uſually ſmall, and much conſumed.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Waters were contained in the Breaſt or Belly, then the Child's Head being no bigger than ordinary, may be born; but the Body being exceedingly ſwelled with the Waters, will ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                     <p>The caſe being thus, let the Chirurgeon ſlide up his leſt Hand, as aforeſaid, and the inſtrument with the right, juſt to the Breaſt or Belly, to make inciſion, and to let out the Waters: after which, he may with much eaſe finiſh the operation.</p>
                     <p>You muſt know, that 'tis much more difficult to deliver a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Birth, or two joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than one that has the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: becauſe the bigneſs of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropick parts may be eaſily leſſened by a ſingle inciſion, which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to let out the Waters which diſtend; and then 'tis eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But when a monſtrous Child, or a double one, is to be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſingle apertion is not enough, but ſometimes 'tis neceſſary to take off whole Members from theſe Bodies, which makes the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much more painful and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and requires more time and skill to effect it; in which caſe the left Hand muſt be introduced into the Womb, and the ſharp knife with the right juſt to the parts that are to be divided and ſeparated, and there with all the care that may be, the member of the monſtrous Child muſt, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, be taken off juſt at the Joynt. And when there are two Children joyned together, the ſeparation muſt be made juſt in the place where they joyn; and afterwards they may be delivered one after the other; always taking them by the Feet, and if it hath but one, the ſame thing may be accompliſhed, after having leſſened the bigneſs of it, by cutting off ſome one of the Members.</p>
                     <p>The inſtrument ought to be as long as an ordinary Crochet, for the more ſurety and facility; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that holding the handle of it with the right Hand, it may be thruſt, drawn, ſloped and turned, without pain, to any ſide at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and with the leſt, which is within the Womb, it may be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cut and diſmember more skilfully and eaſily thoſe parts which muſt be ſeparated. Wherefore it ought to have a handle ſo long, that the Chirurgeon's right Hand without the Womb may hold and govern it as aboveſaid, and conduct it the better in the operation; which would not be ſo ſafely and conveniently done, if this inſtrument were ſo very ſhort, as all other Authors recommend: becauſe in this occaſion the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Hand is ſo conſtrained and preſſed in the Womb, that he can hardly there have the liberty to move his fingers ends, which is the cauſe why he cannot without much difficulty govern ſuch an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with one Hand only, unleſs he would very much force and offer violence to the Womb, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exceedingly endanger the poor Woman's life. Let us now come to the extraction of a dead Child, and ſhew the ſeveral ways of doing it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of delivering a dead Child.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen the Infant is dead in the Mother's Belly, the Labour is ever long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becauſe for the moſt part it comes wrong; or, thô it comes right with the Head, the Woman's Pains are ſo weak and ſlow in theſe caſes, that ſhe cannot bring it forth, and ſometimes ſhe has none at all; foraſmuch as Nature, half overthrown by the death of the Child, which cannot help it ſelf, labours ſo little, that many times it cannot finiſh the buſineſs it has begun, but moſt yield without the help of Art, of which at that time it has great need. However, before you come to manual operation, endeavour to ſtir up the Woman's Pains with ſharp and ſtrong Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to bring on Throws to bear down and bring forth the Child: But if all this prevails not, ſhe muſt be delivered by Art.</p>
                     <p>We have already declared the ſigns to know a dead Child in the Womb, of which the chief are; if the Woman perceives it not to ſtir, nor has a long time before; if ſhe be very cold, much pain and heavineſs in the bottom of her Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if the Child be not ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but always falls like a maſs of Lead to that ſide on which the Woman lies, if the Burthen or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring has been a long time in the World; and if no pulſation be there felt; and that dark and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing putrid matter comes away from the Womb. All theſe ſigns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or moſt of them, ſhew the Child is aſſuredly dead; which when the Chirurgeon is certain of, he muſt do his endeavor to fetch it as ſoon as poſſible he can, and having placed the Woman accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to former directions; if the Child offers the Head firſt, he muſt gently put it back, until he has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to introduce his Hand quite into the Womb, and ſliding it all along under the Belly to find the Feet, let him draw it forth by them, as is formerly taught; being very careful to keep the Head from being lockt in the paſſage, and that it be not ſeparated from the Body, which may eaſily be done, when the Child being very rotten and putrefied, the Chirurgeon does not obſerve the circumſtances of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated by us, that is, (in drawing it forth) to keep the Breaſt and Face downwards. And if, notwithſtanding all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, the Head, becauſe of the
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:52816:308"/>great putrefaction, ſhould be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and remain behind in the Womb, it muſt be drawn forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directions given in the proper Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But when the Head coming firſt, is ſo far advanced and engaged among the Bones of the paſſage, that it cannot be put back, then being very ſure by all the ſigns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or moſt of the chief of them, that the Child is certainly dead, 'tis better to draw it forth, than to torment the Woman too much by putting it back, to turn it and bring it by the Feet. But becauſe it being a part round and ſlippery, by reaſon of the moiſture, the Chirurgeon cannot take hold of it with his Fingers, nor put them upon the ſide of it, becauſe the paſſage is filled with its big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he muſt take a crotchet, and put up as far as he can without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, between the Womb and the Child's Head, where he muſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it, endeavoring to give it good hold upon one of the bones of the Skull, that it may not ſlide, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the point of it, which muſt be ſtrong, that it may not turn; and after the Crotchet is well fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Head, he may therewith draw it forth, keeping the ends of the Fingers of his left Hand flat upon the oppoſite ſide, the better to help to diſengage it, and by wagging it by little and little, to conduct it directly out of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>It were to be wiſhed that it were poſſible to introduce the Crotchet ſo far, that one might fix it (for the better hold) in one of the Eye-holes, or cavities of the Ears; but very often there is not room at firſt to carry them beyond the middle of the Head, and then they muſt be faſtned according to our directions; and rather, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the hinder part than any other, that ſo it may be drawn forth in a ſtreight line; and when by the firſt faſtning of the Crotchet the Head is drawn lower, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be diſengaged, you may looſen it out of the firſt place to faſten it farther up, that ſtronger hold may be taken, and ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively removing and faſtning of it, until the Head be quite born, and then taking hold of it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Hands only, the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be drawn into the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; and ſo ſliding the Fingers of both Hands under the Arm-pits, the Child may be quite delivered, and then the Burthen fetcht to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the operation, according to knowledge; being careful not to pull the Navel-ſtring too hard, leſt it break, as it often happens when it is corrupted.</p>
                     <p>If the dead Child (of which above all, there muſt be good aſſurance) comes with the Arm up to the Shoulders ſo extremely ſwelled, that the Woman muſt ſuffer too much violence to have it put back, 'tis beſt then to take it off at the Shoulder-joint, by twiſting it three or four times about, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taught in another place, by which means there is no need of either Knives, Sawes, or ſharp Pincers, as ſome Authors will have it; it being very eaſily performed without all that proviſion, becauſe of the ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of the Body. After that the Arm is ſo ſeparated, and no longer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the paſſage, the Chirurgeon
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:52816:308"/>will have more room to put up his Hand into the Womb to fetch the Child by the Feet, and bring it away as has been directed.</p>
                     <p>Althô the Chirurgeon be ſure that the Child is dead in the Womb, and that it is neceſſary to fetch it by Art, he muſt not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently uſe his Crotchets, becauſe they are never to be uſed but when Hands are not ſufficient, and that there is no other remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Woman's danger, or to bring the Child any other way; becauſe, very often, thô he has done all that Art directs, perſons preſent, that underſtand not theſe things, will believe that the Child was killed with the Crotchets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô it had been dead three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and without other reaſonings or better underſtanding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for recompence of his ſaving the Mother's life, requite him with an accuſation, of which he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together innocent; and in caſe the Mother by misfortune ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dye, lay her death alſo to his charge, and inſtead of praiſe and thanks, treat him like a Butcher or a Hangman; to which divers Midwives are uſually very ready to contribute, and are the firſt that make the poor Women, that have need of the Men, afraid of them. So much they are in fear of being blamed by them, for having them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves been the cauſe (as ſome of them often are) of the death of Infants, and many ill accidents, which after befall the poor Women, not cauſing them to be helped in due time, and from the moment they perceive the difficulty of the Labour to paſs their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>To avoid therefore theſe calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, let the Chirurgeon never uſe theſe Crotchets but very rarely, and when there is no other way, as alſo to endeavour his utmoſt (as much as the caſe will permit) to bring the Child whole, although dead, and not by bits and pieces, that thereby the wicked and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may have no pretence of blame. I ſay, as much as the caſe will permit, that is, with reſpect to the Woman under his hands: For to ſave her, he had better ſometime bring the dead Child with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than kill her, by torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with exceſſive violence to bring it whole. But, in a word, we muſt in conſcience do what Art commands, without heed what may be ſpoken afterwards: And every Chirurgeon, that has a well ordered Conſcience, will ever have a greater regard to his Duty than reputation; in performing of which let him expect his reward from GOD.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of extracting a</hi> Mola, and falſe Conception.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Mole is nothing but a fleſhy ſubſtance, without Bones, Joynts, or diſtinction of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; without form and figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and determined; engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred againſt Nature in the Womb, after copulation, out of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Seed of both Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Notwithſtanding, there are ſometimes that have ſome rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a rough form. It has no Burthen, nor Navel-ſtring faſtned to it, as a Child always has; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Mole it ſelf adheres to the Womb, by which means it receives nouriſhment from its voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. When Women miſcarry of them before the ſecond Month, they are called falſe Conceptions: when they keep them longer, and this ſtrange body begins to grow bigger, they are called Moles.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince theſe things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb, are totally Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural, their expulſion muſt be procured as ſoon as poſſible, which is very difficult, when theſe ſtrange Bodies cleave to it, and eſpecially the <hi>Mola,</hi> which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn forth, will often conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue two or three whole years, nay, ſometimes the whole remaining part of the Woman's life, as <hi>Parey</hi> tells us in the ſtory of a Pewterer's Wife that had one ſeventeen years, whom he opened after her death.</p>
                     <p>To avoid the like accident, and abundance of inconveniences, which a <hi>Mola</hi> brings, it muſt be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be expelled as ſoon as may be, trying before you come to manual operation, to cauſe the Woman to expel it of her ſelf: To which purpoſe give her ſtrong and ſharp Clyſters, to ſtir up Throws to open the Womb to give way to it, relaxing and moiſtning it with emollient Ointments, Oils and Greaſe, not omitting bleeding in the Foot, and half Baths, if there be occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mola</hi> will certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by theſe means, provided it be but of an indifferent bigneſs, or that it adheres little, or not at all to the Womb; but if it cleaves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrongly to the bottom of the Womb, or that it be very big, the Woman will hardly be rid of it without the help of a Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Hand; in which caſe, after that he has placed the Woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, as if he were to fetch a dead Child, let him ſlide his Hand
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:52816:309"/>into the Womb, and with it draw forth the <hi>Mola,</hi> uſing (if it be ſo big as that it cannot be brought whole, which is very rare, becauſe it is a ſoft tender Body, much more pliable than a Child) a crotchet or knife to draw it forth, or divide it into two or more parts, as the caſe ſhall require. If the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon finds it joyned and faſtned to the Womb, he muſt gently ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it with his fingers ends, his Nails being well pared, putting them by little and little between the <hi>Mola</hi> and the Womb, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on that ſide, where it does not ſtick ſo faſt, and purſuing it ſo, till it be quite looſened; being very careful, if it grows too faſt, not to rend or hurt the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Womb, proceeding according to the directions we have given for the extraction of a Burthen ſtaying behind in the Womb, when the ſtring is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
                     <p>As to a falſe Conception, thô it be much leſs than a <hi>Mola,</hi> yet it often puts a Woman in hazard of her life, becauſe of great Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which very often happen, when the Womb would diſcharge it ſelf of it, and endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it, the Floodings ſeldom ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until it be come away, becauſe the Womb ſtill endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, by which the Blood is excited to flow away, and in a manner ſqueezed out of the open veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The beſt and ſafeſt remedy for a Woman in this caſe, is to fetch away the falſe Conception as ſoon as may be, becauſe the Womb can very ſeldom, without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty void it without help: For it being very ſmall, the Woman's impulſe in bouring downwards can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo effectual, when the Womb is but little diſtended by ſo ſmall a body, as when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a conſiderable bulk in it; for then it is more ſtrongly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the Throws. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times 'tis exceeding difficult to fetch theſe falſe Conceptions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Womb does not open and dilate it ſelf ordinarily beyond the proportion of what it contains, and that being very little, ſo is its open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which is the reaſon why the Chirurgeon ſometimes is ſo far from introducing his whole Hand, that he can ſcarce put in a few Fingers, with which he is forced to finiſh the operation, as well as he can, proceeding in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he has introduced them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Caeſarean Section.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen a big-bellied Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is effectively in Labour, 'tis very rare but that an expert Chirurgeon can deliver the Child dead or alive, whole or in pieces; in a word, that he may do the work compleatly, if he behaves himſelf as the caſe requires, and according to the directions given in each particular Chapter forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, treating of the ſeveral unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Labours, without being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated in a very inhumane, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and barbarous manner, to have recourſe to the Caeſarian operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during the Mother's life, as ſome Authors have too inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ordered; but never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>However, after the Mother's death, if there be any hopes to find the Child alive (eſpecially in thoſe Countries, where the Laws forbid the burying a Woman with Child, before it is taken out of her Belly) this operation may be undertaken. To accompliſh which as it ought to be, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Woman in the agony, he muſt quickly make ready all things neceſſary for his work, to loſe no time, becauſe delay will certainly be the death of the Infant, which elſe a few moments before might have been brought alive. There are ſome, that when the Woman is juſt a dying, would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what put between her Teeth to keep her Mouth open, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the outer part of the Womb: to the end the Infant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by this means ſome little air and refreſhment, may not be ſo ſoon ſuffocated: But all this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery will avail but little; becauſe the Child lives only by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Blood, whilſt it is in the Womb; but if he will needs do
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:52816:310"/>ſo, it is rather to content the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, than out of any belief of the good it will do.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon then as the Woman has breathed her laſt, and that ſhe is dead (to which all the company muſt agree) he ſhall begin his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which the Greeks call <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryulcy.</hi> Moſt Authors would have it made on the left ſide of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is more free from the Liver, which is on the right; but if my Opinion may be authentick, it will be better and more skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made juſt in the middle of the Belly; between the two right Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles; becauſe in this place there is only the coverings and the white line to cut; when on the Side it cannot be done without cutting the two oblique and croſs Muſcles, which being couched one under the other, make a conſiderable thickneſs, beſides that it bleeds more than towards the middle of the Belly; not that the loſs of Blood is of any moment (which will flow when the Woman is but juſt dead) but becauſe it hinders by its flowing, the ſeeing diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how to make the operation as it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>To diſpatch then with more eaſe and ſpeed, the Chirurgeon having placed the dead Body, that the Belly may be a little raiſed, let him take a good ſharp inciſion knife, very ſharp on one ſide, with which he muſt quickly make, at one ſtroak, or at two or three at the moſt (if he will for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſurety) an inciſion juſt in the middle of the Belly, between the two right Muſcles unto the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> of the length and extent of the Womb or thereabouts; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he muſt only pierce the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> with the point of his inſtrument, to make an orifice for one or two of the Fingers of his left Hand, into which he muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thruſt them to cut it (lifting it up with them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the inſtrument for fear of pricking the Guts) in proportion to the firſt inciſion of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which having done, the Womb will ſoon appear, in which he muſt make an inciſion in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he did in the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> being careful not to thruſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument at once too far in, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find the Womb a Finger or two thick (as all Authors affirm contrary to truth) in which he would be deceived, as theſe are that never well conſidered it. For it is very certain, that at the time of Labour, whilſt it contains the Child and Waters in it, it is not above the thickneſs of a half Crown, although they have all ſung to us, that by Divine Providence and a Miracle, the more it's extended with the Child, the thicker it grows, which is abſolutely falſe; it being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> true, that it is at that time a little thicker at the place where the Burthen cleaves, where its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is then as it were ſpongy; but every where elſe it is very thin, and becomes the more ſo, by how much it is more extended, until being emptied by the birth of the Child, it begins to grow thicker in contracting, and gathering to it ſelf all its ſubſtance, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very much extended. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt like the Bladder, which being full, is very thin, and being empty, it appears to us half a Fingers thickneſs, which filling
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:52816:311"/>again, waxes thinner in proportion to the Urine that flows to it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then ſo opened the Womb, he muſt likewiſe make an inciſion in the Infant's Membranes, taking care not to wound it with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and then he will ſoon ſee it, and muſt immediately take it out with the Burthen, which he muſt nimbly ſeparate from the bottom of the Womb: And finding it to be yet living, let him praiſe GOD for having ſo bleſſed and proſpered his operation.</p>
                     <p>But the Children ſo delivered in theſe caſes are uſually ſo weak (if not quite dead, as it often happens), that 'tis hard to know whether they be alive or dead. Yet one may be confident the Child is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if by touching the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, the umbilical Arteries are perceived to move; as alſo the Heart, by laying the Hand on the Breaſt; and if it prove ſo, means muſt be uſed to fetch it to it ſelf, ſpouting ſome Wine in the Noſe and Mouth, warming it until it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to come to ſtir of it ſelf, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives uſually lay the Burthen very hot on the Belly of ſuch weak Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if that helps, 'tis rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the temperate heat of it, than for any other cauſe: for 'tis impoſſible the Infant ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Spirits from it, after it is once ſeparated from the Womb, and yet leſs when the Woman is dead. The beſt and ſpeedieſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is immediately to ſeparate it, and open the Child's Mouth, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unſtopping all the Noſe, if there be any filth, to help it ſo to breath freely, keeping it all the while near the fire, until it has a little recovered its weakneſs, ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Wine into the Noſe and Mouth of it, that he may a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle taſte and ſcent it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt it in this juncture, if one obſerves ſome moderation in the thing.</p>

When the ſwelling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times increaſes, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes: It increaſes becauſe either a greater portion of the Gut comes down; or it is over full, either of Wind or Ordure. If the ſwelling increaſe becauſe Excrements are
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:52816:312"/>got into the Gut, then the Gut cannot be put back, there is a pain in the Cod, Groin and Belly, by reaſon of ſolution of continuity; the Stomach is diſordered, and caſts forth brown choler, then black, and laſt of all the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; There is alſo an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Stories. 2. The ſecond ſign of a <hi>Hernia inteſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> is, That the ſwelling is not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 3. The ſwelling ſometimes is almoſt quite gone. 4. Being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it eaſily gives back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and then ſlips out again with a great noiſe. 5. The ſwelling is ſmooth, ſlippery and round.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a <hi>Hernia omenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> are 1. The ſwelling is always the ſame, 2. To the fooling it is uneven, ſoft and ſlippery, becauſe of its Fat.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of <hi>Hernia aquoſa</hi> are 1. The ſwelling abates after faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 2. The veins in the <hi>Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It ſhmes, and is pellucid, and if you hold a Candle on the oppoſite ſide, it appears as if you lookt through Glaſs or Horn. 4. There is no pain. 5. It comes not on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but by degrees.</p>
                     <p>The ſign of a <hi>Hernia ventoſa</hi> are, 1. The Veins are ſwelled. 2. It looks clearer than a <hi>Hernia aquoſa.</hi> 3. It comes on a ſudden.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a <hi>Hernia carnoſa</hi> are, 1. A ſchirrhous hardneſs. 2. It changes not the colour of the Stones. 3. It abides always at the ſame bigneſs. 4. The lower parts of the Teſticle may be ſtirred.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of a <hi>Hernia varicoſa</hi> are, 1. The Veins are turgid on a cluſter, and wreathen, like Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſpers. 2. The Teſticle hangs lower down, becauſe of the weight of the Humors.</p>
                     <p>The conjunct cauſe is the Gut or Cawl ſlipt down. The ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is either the diſtention or breach of the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> And it is diſtended or broke by cauſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal, as the Humors that are contained in the Body; or external, as by a blow, loud crying, leaping, keeping ones breath, preſſure of a weight, too much violence in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, eſpecially when the Belly is charged with Excrements or Wind.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſticks, All Ruptures are difficult of Cure: Becauſe a thin and nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is very difficultly united; nor is it cured by Medicines, unleſs the Rupture be ſmall, lately made, and in Children; but either with Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Irons, or by Section.</p>

But if it be full of excrements or wind, a bath of warm water muſt be got ready, then Lenients muſt be applied, and afterwards a Fomentation with a cloth warm.

                     <p>THe intentions of Cure are the ſame here as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter. The Gut muſt be put up, and care muſt be taken, that it ſlip not down again; which is done by uniting and glewing up the Rupture. It is united by aſtringents.

The courſe of forty days is alſo proper.</p>
                     <p>If theſe means will not do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Avicen,</hi> the place muſt be ſeared with a hot iron. The ſearing muſt be ſtrong, becauſe ſo the skin is contracted, that the Gut cannot any more come down. But you muſt have a care that the Inteſtine feel not the ſtrength of the fire, nor be burnt; for there would be danger of death. The Patient therefore muſt be laid on his back, with his Head low, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Gut is reduced, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt lay his Hand on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Belly, and preſs it hard. The Patient muſt be tied upon the Table with many Ligatures, on the Breaſt, Arms, Hips, Knees and Feet; the ſwathes of the Breaſt muſt be broad. It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deſend the ſpermatick veſſels, by hurting of which the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seed is loſt; but it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to life. The ſearing-Irons muſt be of two forms, ſemicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and pointed, that they may have a ſharp point, and the figure of a Cone. We begin to fear at the upper part, deſcending along the whole region of the Rupture.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is alſo performed by inciſion, which is twofold, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgical, or Empirical. True Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:52816:314"/>cure it without extracting a Stone: Empiricks cut off a Stone. Without extracting a Stone, it is performed in this manner. Firſt of all the Patient ſtanding muſt hold his breath, that we may know how large the Rupture is. Then the tumefied part muſt be marked round with ink, according to the bigneſs of the place affected. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Patient muſt be tied upon a Table, and a ſervant muſt preſs the bottom of his Belly. The Chirurgeon muſt with his left hand lift up the marked skin, as much as he can, and with a Penknife cut the circle diametrically, through the Skin and Membranes, to the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> either burſt or dilated, which muſt be ſowed up afterwards, together with the Skin and Membranes. The ſeminal veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels muſt be kept unhurt. After the Patient muſt be put to Bed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt applied pledgets <hi>cum ovi albumine,</hi> and then glutinants, as <hi>pulvis boli, &amp;c.</hi> and things alſo that breed fleſh, as <hi>Terebinthina, &amp;c.</hi> applying over all <hi>Emplaſtrum barbarum.</hi> When a cicatrice is bred, the Patient may riſe, and wear an aſtringent Plaſter for ſeveral days, and a Truſs likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>The uſual and dangerous way, with extraction of a Stone, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Paulus, cap.</hi> 65. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. The Patient being laid on his Back, the Gut reduced, he tied, and a Servant preſſing the part, they make an oblique mark in the Groin. Then they make a deep inciſion, ſo that the Stone and the ſpermatick veſſels may be taken out. They hold theſe with their left hand, putting their ſingers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hole, they ſeparate all the Membranes, and extract the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at the hole. Then they take hold of the parts with hooks made for that purpoſe, and ſow all up. Then they cut off all above the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards fear it with a hot iron, to prevent a Haemorrhage, and to glutinate the parts the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Which done, they leave along thread, putting in ſome concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine. Afterwards, they make a hole in the ſame part of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and put in ſome conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Medicine, they uſe Butter (which nevertheleſs putrefies) they mix <hi>thus, aut ovi vitellum, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum reſinae terebinthinae.</hi> Then they endeavour to breed fleſh, with <hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THis Rupture is not made by the breach of the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum;</hi> becauſe no great portion of the <hi>Omentum</hi> comes down, it being faſtned to the bottom of the Stomach, the Gut <hi>Colon,</hi> and to the Spine. Therefore it is made by diſtention of the coat; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe the <hi>Omentium</hi> is fat, which may very well therefore make lax and dilate, but never break.</p>
                     <p>The intentions of cure are two. Firſt, the <hi>Omentum</hi> muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced within the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> which is done with the Hands: Then, it muſt be kept from coming down again, which is done by Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.

It is to be noted, according to <hi>Celſus c.</hi> 25. <hi>l.</hi> 7. That if a ſmall portion of the <hi>Omentum</hi> come down, it muſt be forced up again: If a great one it muſt be ſeared, that it may dye and fall off: The readieſt way is to bind, cut off and burn it. Yet we muſt not raſhly and too ſoon proceed to Section; becauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes a Rupture is cured beyond expectation.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe cauſes of a <hi>Hernia aquoſa</hi> are either occult or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, according to <hi>Aetius cap.</hi> 22. <hi>l.</hi> 14. The manifeſt are percuſſion, colliſion, and breach of the veſſels in the Stones: for the Blood that flows to the veſſels is then turned into a watry ſubſtance, becauſe of the weakneſs of the part. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult cauſe is from the veſſels being filled with a watry Humidity. <hi>Guido</hi> adds, ſome fault in the Liver, or Spleen, by reaſon whereof a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor gathers in the <hi>Hypocondria,</hi> which eaſily falls down.</p>
                     <p>Percuſſion, Colliſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are apparent of themſelves. If the colour and habit of the Body be bad, the Rupture proceeds from a fault in ſome of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> If none of theſe, from Repletion: and Repletion proceeds from Drinking too much. <hi>Aetius</hi> diſtinguiſhes the Cauſes by the Humor: which if it be yellowiſh and pale, the Rupture comes from repletion of the Veins; if dull, from Percuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if white, from ſome fault of the Liver or Spleen. We muſt know, that ſometimes water is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gathered in the coat, which immediately involves the Stones; oftentimes between it and the <hi>Elytroeides;</hi> ſometimes between the <hi>Elytroeides</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cures the cauſes muſt be removed, the faults of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Spleen amended. If it comes from too much drinking, we muſt abſtain from it. The abundance of watry humor muſt be evacuated, both what is in the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> and the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and what is redundant in the whole Body. For which purpoſe <hi>Sarſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parilla</hi> in decoctions is very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Beſides, Diureticks and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are good; but Diureticks are beſt. Diureticks are known, which muſt be taken frequently; as alſo ſuch Medicines as purge thin and ſerous Humors by ſtool, ſuch as <hi>Syrupus è roſis laxativus pilulae cochiae, &amp; maſtichinae, vel aloephanginae, quarum ſcrupulus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere poteſt cum elaterri gr.</hi> ij.</p>
                     <p>As for local Medicines, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of them is to evacuate water contained in the Stones: which is done, if it either give back to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellents, or be brought out by Digeſtives through ſome patent place, or by Scarification.

                     </argument>
                     <p>A <hi>Sarcocele,</hi> or Fleſh-rupture comes from a defluxion of thick Humors, which are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the coats of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles. The thick Humors are two, Phlegm and Melancholy, of which, <hi>Scirrhi,</hi> and fleſhy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are bred in other parts as well as in the Teſticles.</p>
                     <p>This ſwelling is hard, reſiſting the touch, indolent, and if it be an exquiſite <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe. If it come from Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the colour is ſublivid: If from Phlegm, it changes not the colour of the skin: If from aduſt Melancholy, there is a pricking pain, and the ſwelling is not all alike, but here ſoft, and there hard.</p>
                     <p>This requires the ſame cure with a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> of which we have treated ſufficiently in the Doctrine of Tumors. Only here it is worth the obſervation, that <hi>Pulvis radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis anonidis</hi> taken for ſeveral Months, waſts a <hi>Sarcocele:</hi> which <hi>Matthiolus</hi> makes good by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of a Patient, who by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of the ſaid root reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his health, when before his Phyſicians had given over all hope in Medicines, and placed all they had in cutting and burning.</p>

                     <p>However, if the Diſeaſe do not give way to Medicines; you muſt proceed to cutting, which is not without hazard, whether the Stone be left, or it be taken out. And it muſt be obſerved in this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether fleſh grows about the coats, or about the very Stones; and whether it ſtick firmly or looſely, to the ſubſtance of the part. This being obſerved, you muſt cut quite through the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> till you come at the concrete fleſh; which, if it be not ſtrongly faſtned, muſt by little and little be looſened with the Fingers ends, or the handle of the knife from the Stone, or coats, and taken away: But if it be grown firmly together with the part, it cannot be cured without cutting the veſſels and the Teſticle. In this caſe therefore the veſſels and the Teſticle muſt be drawn out, tied, cut, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some fear them with a red not Razor; and ſo out and ſear at once. The reſt of the cure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as in a <hi>Hernia inteſtinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>

                     <p>THe Rupture called <hi>Ramex varicoſus,</hi> is, when the veins of the Teſticles are dilated and wreathen like Vine-claſpers, by ſome melancholick Humor.</p>

Theſe are approved Medicines; <hi>Succus hypociſtidis, balauſtia, gluten piſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, malicorium, bolus Armena, ſanguis draconis cum ovi albo, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Amputation of a Member.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE next thing, which in my propoſed Method I am to treat of, is the Extirpation of a Part, when by a Gangrene, Wound, Fracture, or ſome other accident, it is become not only uſeleſs, but dangerous to the whole, <hi>Ne pars ſincera trahatur.</hi> In this Caſe it becomes the Chirurgeon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Friends with this kind of Remedy, and withall to make his Prognoſtick accordingly. But before we proceed in this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall take notice of what ſome knowing Authors have writ hereof. For in thoſe places where Amputation cannot be made, as in the Buttock, Shoulder, Back, <hi>&amp;c. Fab. Hildanus</hi> propoſes the uſe of potential Cauteries applied to the mortified Part, and often renewed, till the laſt Eſchar reaches to the live Fleſh. Yet he condemns Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenick, as being venomous, and producing many dangerous ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms. This method in <hi>Sarcomata</hi> has been uſed with good ſucceſs: but in a Mortification there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me many greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that attend it. Firſt, from the Cauſtick it ſelf, as he propoſes it, of <hi>Salts:</hi> It will melt in the working, and is more diſpoſed to ſpread in the Skin, than penetrate deep into the Fleſh. This every young Chirurgeon knows in his making of Fontanels, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply a bit of Cauſtick ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, thô he uſe all his Art in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it, but that it will have ſpread much farther than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it. Then, the ſeparation of ſuch Eſchars is too ſlow to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deſign: and in an ill habit of Body, ſuch Medicaments are apt of themſelves to procure a Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation rather than Cure. Whereas on the contrary, an actual Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwers all Intentions: It not only conſumes the Mortification, but dries up the venomous humor, thereby preventing its further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and alſo communicates warmth to the languiſhing parts, by vertue of which the ſeparation is much farthered. But where An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation it ſelf is feaſible, nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary, as in the Limbs, there ariſes a new Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ought to be done in the ſound part, or in the dead. <hi>Fab. ab Aquapend.</hi> adviſes, the dead within a fingers breadth of the live (as alſo do many others) then with a Cautery they burn up all the remaining Mortification. Others
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:52816:318"/>perform the Operation with a hot Knife. <hi>Aquapendent</hi> ſpeaks ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently of his ſucceſs in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this way, that utterly to deny the thing, were to give him the Lye. I ſhall only make this Objection, That the <hi>Sphacolus</hi> does ſeldom affect the Member ſo equally round, as that an Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the dead part is feaſible: nay, which is worſe, when once the Mortification ſeizes in the great veſſels, it runs up ſo faſt under the skin, that before any conſiderable part of the Member is outwardly gangrened on the one ſide beyond the Knee or Elbow, the other ſide will have reached to the <hi>Inguen</hi> or <hi>Axilla.</hi> This, I confeſs, fruſtrates all manner of Amputating, whether in ſound or mortified parts. Yet generally ſpeaking, the Gangrene grows not ſo faſt, but that if you make Amputation two fingers breadth, more or leſs, within the live Fleſh, you may prevent it; and that for better than it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done by the other way of operating. For if you work there by actual Cautery with a hot Knife, your Knife will ſtick faſt in the Fleſh till the moiſture be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driod up, and then you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat many Knives and Canteries, in every one of which you will meet with the ſame inconvenience: yea, before you can cut through with your hot Knife, it is very probable that you will near the Bone meet with ſome parts that are alive and ſenſible, eſpecially when you come to the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> (for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes do not uſually corrupt at the ſame rate of ſwiftneſs with the Fleſh) and then all your pains and trouble will be as great or greater, than if you did it in the ſound part. <hi>Hildanus</hi> mentions ſeveral other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, who has taken pains to confute this opinion.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe ways of Amputation ſeem to me much more difficult and painful than our common way; which makes me preſume they propoſed them, to prevent the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood.</p>
                     <p>But modern Chirurgeons have anſwered this Objection, by good bandages and deligation of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and when we cut above the knee by clapping Cauteries to the veſſels only; which ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that intention. Now I ſhall briefly deliver the whole Doctrine of Amputation.</p>
                     <p>In heat of Fight, whether it be at Sea or Land, the Chirurgeon ought to conſider at the firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, what poſſibility there is of preſerving the wounded Member; and accordingly, if there be no hopes of ſaving it, to make his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at that inſtant, while the Patient is free of a Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make your judgment of the Wounds, I ſhall give you ſome few Remarques of ſuch as require Amputation, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Leg or Arm he ſhattered by ſplinter or great ſhot, the loſs of ſubſtance will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you. If the principal Muſcles be torn off, and the Bone fractured in pieces, or if the wound be with Muſquet-ſhot in the inſide of the joint of the elbow, or in the knee or ancle, with a fracture of the bones of the ſaid joint, nay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it has not fractured them, yet if the Bullet be ſo lodged that you cannot extract it, you ſhall then preſently make extirpation of
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:52816:318"/>the part. If it be the Arm, cut it off in the place where it is ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and ſaw off the end of the Bone ſmooth, your aſſiſtant the while pulling up the muſculous Skin and fleſh. If the Ankle be thus maimed, you ſhall then cut off the Leg within three or four Fingers breadth under the Knee, in regard ſo long a ſtump would be troubleſome. But if the Leg be ſhattered off by the calf, do not put your Patient to the pain of new Amputation, for the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it a hands breadth, or a little more. Save what you can of a ſhattered Hand. And if the Toes with part of the Foot were ſhot off, cut off the lacerated parts ſmooth, but with care to ſave as much of the Foot with the Heel as you can; it being much better than a wooden Leg. But if the Arm or Leg be not ſo ſhattered, though the wound be large on one ſide, and hang gaping down with great fracture of the bones, yet be not diſcouraged; the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wound will make for your better pulling out thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous bodies, ſhivers, ſplinters, rags or ought elſe, and for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier diſcharge of matter. Dreſs it as a wound by a ſplinter.</p>
                     <p>If the great joynt be ſo ſhot by Musket-bullet, that you think it not reaſonable to cut off the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, be ſure you make extraction of the Bullet, and free it of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Bodies, leaving not the leaſt ſhiver to prick the Nerves or Tendons: and make ſuch way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, that you may be able to dreſs the wounded Nerves, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without making new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, when the part is inflamed and unfit for it.</p>
                     <p>If after ſome days the wound do not digeſt, but inflame and Gangrene, and the Gangrene do not yield to your applications; then, as in a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> you are to proceed with the extirpation of the rotten member, while the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is free from <hi>Delirium,</hi> and has ſtrength to bear the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Seat him ſo as it may be for your conveniency. At Sea they ſit or lye, no great matter which; nor has the Chirurgeon any body to hold them; but with the help of his Mates, and ſome one or two that belongs to the Hold, he goes on with his work. Yet where we have convenience to proceed more formally, we always place the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to our moſt advantage, where he may be held firm, and in a clear light, and ſo that our aſſiſtants may come better about us. The Member is to be ſupported by ſome one, whilſt another ſtands behind the Patient, and draws up the skin and muſculous fleſh. Then make your Ligature two fingers breadth, or thereabout in the ſound part; ſo that if you ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in caſe of mortification, you may be ſure to quit your ſelf of it.</p>
                     <p>This Ligature is omitted by many of our Chirurgeons here in the City, they only making a turn with a Tape, pinning it on as a mark to circumcide by: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Ligature I propoſe, they make a gripe, which gripe is commonly made by ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who has ſtrength to do it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is good, where a ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Membrane is to be cut off, to ſmooth the ſtump; in which caſe
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:52816:319"/>there is no great fear of bleeding. But in Amputations it ſeems to me to be very inconvenient: for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw any man ſo gripe, but that ſtill the Artery bled with a greater force than was allowable. It being ſo, in what a huddle is the ſtump then dreſt? But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the uneaſie poſture, and the long griping tires the griper; or that his hand be crampt the while, what condition is the Patient then in? Whereas by this ancient way of Ligature, the veſſels are ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from bleeding, the member be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunimed, and the fleſh held ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ready to receive the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their crooked knife (or, razor, which many have amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with.)</p>
                     <p>This Ligature made, the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlent ſtrengthens it, whilſt he draws up the muſculous fleſh. In the mean time the Operator, with a ſharp crooked knife, by a turn with his hand, cuts the fleſh off round to the bone; then with the back of it he ſcrapes the <hi>Pericſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> from the bone; if there be two bones, then with a dividing knife he ſcparates the fleſhy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane from them. The bones freed of the <hi>Perioſteum, Guido</hi> propoſes a linen cloth, and <hi>Hildanus</hi> a kind of Purſe, to be brought over the upper divided fleſh, to pull it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and make more way for the Saw. But I think that needleſs. The fleſh divided, the parts ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enough of themſelves; beſides, the aſſiſtents pulling up the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fleſh and skin is ſufficient. That done, you are at liberty, whether you will cauterize the veſſels by a Button-cautery, or by Ligature ſtop the bleeding, or by agglutination. The uſe of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthum</hi> I do not approve. To apply eſcharoticks to the ends of the Nerves and Tendons newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, cauſes great pain, weakens the part, and makes way for Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene; it not being likely you can ſo apply them to the Artery, but that you muſt burn the parts about, which are, as I ſaid, the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The way <hi>Hildanus</hi> propoſes, by drawing the veſſels out by a <hi>Forceps,</hi> is not a work to be done in heat of ſight, nor without a clear day-light. If you attempt it on Land, his Arm would be bowed, and his Leg ſtretcht out, that the veſſels may be the longer after extirpation, that you may the better take hold of them. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Parey</hi> propoſes a more eaſie and ſure way of deligation, by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Needle with a ſtrong twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thread through the skin near the great veſſels, by piercing through the raw fleſh and skin: then make your Ligature upon a fold of rag.</p>
                     <p>Thus you bind the Artery and Vein. Theſe ſeveral ways have been practiſed by eminent Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons for the ſtopping the Blood in the Arteries in Amputation, but the late diſcovery of the Royal ſtyptick has rendred them of leſs uſe. But in heat of fight it will be neceſſary to have your actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery always ready, for that will ſecure the bleeding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in a moment, and fortify the part againſt future putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they requiring after cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation no ſuch ſtrict bandage, as that thereby you need to fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception of the Spirits. When
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:52816:319"/>we cauterize the Artery, we do then touch the end of the bone, it haſtning exſoliation.</p>
                     <p>The next thing is the looſning the Ligature, and bringing the Lips cloſe over the ſtump. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhould with a croſs ſtitch hold them ſo, or content your ſelf by bandage, as well as you can, is by ſome controverted. They that object againſt the former, ſay, it cauſes pain and inflammation. So does bandage alſo, if it be made too ſtrait. Therefore they ſhould object againſt that alſo. The moſt that are done without the croſs ſtitch, are the next dreſſing broad ſtumps, ſome of them with Lips turned outward by the bandage; in the leaſt of them the whole ſtump is bare: whereas in thoſe in which the croſs ſtitch is made, the Lips are found cloſe to the bone at the next dreſſing, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great veſſels, and a third part, or half of the ſtump is well digeſted; and oftentimes by the ſecond dreſſing near agglutinated, ſo far as it lies under the skin, and without inflammation happily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whereas the broad ſtump is a certain ſign of a long cure, and commonly the death of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. If the muſculous fleſh and skin are well pulled up in time of Amputation, and brought over by a moderate extenſion as far as they will eaſily admit, you will find it not painful. You ought to pierce the skin with a needle and ſtrong brown thread, ceared about half an inch from the edges of the Lips.</p>
                     <p>Having made them croſs from ſide to ſide equally, tie them with a moderate aſtriction, then apply a pledgit on the cauterized veſſels with <hi>pulv. rad. irid. ſucc. cepar. cum melle.</hi> But if no cautery was uſed, then buttons of Tow ſpread with your reſtrictive, and dipt in <hi>pulv. Galeni,</hi> muſt be applied to the mouths of the veſſels.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the extirpation of a cancerous Breaſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF notwithſtanding all your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endeavors to cure a Cancer, the Tumor increaſe, and be like to ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate, you may do well to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn the Patient of the danger: and if it be looſe, and in a place where it may be ſafely extirpated, propoſe it to them, leſt afterwards they deſire it when it is too late.</p>
                     <p>That you may be the more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in the operation, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to your conſideration theſe few qualifications. Firſt, that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be of a ſtrong conſtitution, and of a tolerable good habit of Body, and not in a declining age, when the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are ceaſed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Cancer be looſe, and the <hi>axilla</hi> free from painful glands. It were alſo to be wiſht, that the <hi>Cancer</hi> took its original from ſome accident, as a bruiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the operation be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Spring, or Autumn of the year: leſt through the great heat of the Summer the ſpirits be reſolved; or by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold in the winter, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat ſhould be choaked.</p>
                     <p>In order to the operation you ought to have good rollers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, reſtrictive powders, and defenſatives, as in other amputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The uſe of <hi>Chalcanthum</hi> or
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:52816:320"/>other eſcharoticks I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove: for you cannot apply them ſo to the mouths of the Arteries, but they will corrode the adjacent parts, and cauſe pain, which ought not to be, eſpecially in a <hi>Cancer.</hi> Beſides, they require a ſtrict ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which is very troubleſome on the Breaſts. To avoid which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, I propoſe the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Blood by a ſmall but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-cautery; which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not done without ſome pain, but that is momentary, and ſerves to correct the indiſpoſition of the part: whereas the other lies gnawing ſo long as it is upon the part, and renders it crude and indiſpoſed. There ought to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauteries of different ſorts ready heated in ſome corner of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, leſt in the extirpation there happen to be leſt ſome reliques of a cancerous gland behind. All things being ready, the Patient muſt be placed in a chair to the light, and held ſteady. It is then at the operators choice, whether he will make a Ligature about the <hi>baſis</hi> of the cancerous Tumor, or pull it to him with one hand, while he cuts it off with the other. For the cutting into the Breaſt, and pulling out the cancerated knot, rarely ſucceeds well: nor indeed is every Breaſt ſo capable of being freed of the <hi>Cancer,</hi> when it is cut off by making a Ligature. If the <hi>Cancer</hi> be cut off clear, your buſineſs is then to ſtop the blood as you pleaſe: but if any ſcirrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity remain, you ſhall do well to conſume it by actual cautery. The Ancients uſed in theſe operations to permit them to bleed freely; nay, provoked them to it by cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the blood; after which, the actual cautery was applied all over, then they dreſſed the wound as a burn: but according to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <hi>pulv. Galeni</hi> is moſt proper. Then palce the Patient in bed, and give her an auodyne draught that night, to quiet the ferment. The ſecond or third day after you may dreſs her with ſome digeſtive, as that <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>terebinth. lotae</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> ℥iſs. <hi>ſucc. plantag. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lani, an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſucc. apii</hi> ℥j. <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantur ad dimid. ſuccor. conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionem; dein adde far. hord. &amp; ciceris an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>croci</hi> ℈ij. <hi>vitell. unius ovi.

And if they had no Fontanels before, make them ſome now: for thô the Cure may ſeem ſucceſsful, yet if there be any evil quality in the Humors remaining, the Ulcer will ſcarce cicatrize.</p>
                     <p>If in cicatrizing it the Lips do grow callous, attempt the eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating timely by actual cautery, whilſt it is within a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and lies in the <hi>ſuperficies:</hi> for if you defer it till it has ſiezed the Muſculous fleſh, it will be too late, it being then ſcarce capable of pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.

                     </p>
                     <p>Empiricks amongſt us brag much of their skill in curing of them; and, by the giving of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi>'s Pills, or <hi>Opium</hi> mixt with ſome purgative, they do now and then alleviate pain, and thereby encourage diſeaſed people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves into their hands, whom if they can perſwade to an Amputation, they get ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in hand: but their frequent miſcarriages in that work, have taught the more prudent people to avoid them.</p>
                     <p>Some eminent Chirurgeons, I ſuppoſe, after a fruitleſs endeavor to cure them, have attempted the extirpating of them by Eſcharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. <hi>Guido</hi> has commended to us Arſnick powdered and ſprinkled daily upon them, the Eſchar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt pulled off. <hi>Riverius</hi> in his obſervations tells of a Cancer that was extirpated by this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. ℞ <hi>aq. fort.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>ſublimati crudi</hi> ℥ viij. <hi>ſalis Ammoniaci</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>arſenici</hi>

Theſe are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> then the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put mortuum</hi> powdered, and the like weight of Vinegar to be put thereto, and diſtilled again to the conſiſtence of a ſoft paſte for uſe. <hi>Ol. arſenici, aq. regia, ol. vitrioli, lap. cauſtic, &amp;c.</hi> have been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. When ſuch are applied, there will be need of good defenſatives. By the Authority of ſome of theſe Authors, young Chirurgeons have been ſometimes ingaged to their prejudice: and ſome years ſince an eminent Chirurgeon, ſince decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, undertook the eradicating of an ulcerated Cancer in the Breaſt of a Woman that had ſtrength and courage to endure it. He applied the ſtrongeſt of the fore-mentioned Eſcharoticks: they penetrated deep and made great ſloughs, which he pulled off, and by repeating the Eſcharoticks raiſed new; but the uſe of them was not long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for the gleet partaking of the corroſives, ulcerated the adjacent parts; and the Cancer was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Eſcharoticks, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was no good to be done by them. Indeed if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Medicaments, that could have penetrated deep with little pain, there might have been ſome hopes of ſucceſs. So cancerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences and Ulcers in the Mouth are increaſed by touching them with Oil of Vitriol, Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which conſideration there remain but two ways, either the actual Cautery, or palliative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. If the Cancer be in ſuch a place as you may hope to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, the actual Cautery is then a ſure help: but not by applying it lightly upon the upper parts; but by thruſting at the root with a ſcoop, or chiſel-like Cautery, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it away before you. If there remain any rags of it, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:52816:321"/>button-Cautery, burn it down to a cruſt: but if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected, then endeavor pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation by ſuch Medicaments as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove have been propoſed. And in caſe the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> or Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids be ſtopt, bleed by venaeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or by Leeches, and make Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanels: for by ſuch means many people live tolerably well, who have Cancers ulcerated; when others, who ailed leſs, by their impatience are dead.</p>

                        <p>Of taking away Blood by Venaeſection, Scarification, and Leeches.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THô one would think that but little skill were required in opening a vein; yet it often ſo happens, that this very thing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates trouble to the Artiſt, and no ſmall pain to the Patient, either when the Artiſt cannot undertake the work, or, if he does undertake it, when he cannot attain his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end.</p>
                     <p>When he does not undertake it, it is either becauſe the Vein that ſhould be opened, does not appear, or the Chirurgeon cannot find it. In which two caſes, as the firſt ſaves the Chirurgeon blameleſs, ſo the latter argues either want of skill, or dulenſs of ſenſe. In the <hi>int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rim</hi> however, thô not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a thing upon occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, diſcovers the ſlenderneſs of the Chirurgeon's skill; yet ſuch an one is to be born withal, yea, in ſome meaſure to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Since it is better to do nothing at all, than to attempt any thing timerouſly or raſhly at another's peril.</p>
                     <p>But when he undertakes the thing, and attains not his deſired end, this happens either becauſe the vein was not touched, or if it was, not as it ought. It was not touched, either becauſe it lay not there, or the Lancet reached it not, or divided it not right. Which ſoever of theſe things happens, it is abſurd, and alien to Art; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it happen through the Patient's fault in ſnatching the Limb away before the Chirurgeon has done his work. If the unskilfulneſs of the Artiſt be in fault, it is either becauſe the bandage was too looſe, or ſome way incongruouſly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reaſon whereof the vein cannot be kept tight, but ſlips away from the hand: or becauſe it is not full enough, but falls down flat, and reſiſts not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument:
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:52816:322"/>or becauſe the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is blunt, or wrong thruſt in.</p>
                     <p>A vein is ill divided when the inciſion is too narrow or too wide, or not correſpondent to the inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the skin. When the orifice is too wide, bleeding in ones ſleep may be feared. When it is too narrow, beſides, that it bleeds not as one would have it, a Tumor ariſes about the wound, which the Greeks call <hi>Thromboſis.</hi> And the ſame thing happens, when the inciſion of the vein and skin is not the one correſpondent to the other; which happens ſeveral ways. Either becauſe the skin is drawn out of its place by the ſillet; or by the Thumb which ſtays the vein: or becauſe the Lancet is put in too obliquely.</p>
                     <p>But there are worſe miſtakes than any yet mentioned, to wit, when the Nerves are hurt, or an Artery is touched. And the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is, it afflicts the Patient the more, for that he finds his calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deſtruction to proceed from what he expected health or help by. Whoever therefore would be accounted a skilful Artiſt in this thing, he muſt endeavour all he can to avoid thoſe miſchiefs: Which he may eaſily do, if he will but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, what out of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and confirmed by frequent experience, I here ſet down.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, the Artiſt's hands muſt be warm, and the Patient muſt ſit upon a Bed or in a Chair (but it is better in Bed, becauſe of ſwooning) then either the Limb muſt be ſo brought to the light, or the light to the Limb, that the place of the vein may be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, as that his hand, when he goes about his work may not be in his light. Some may think this caution about the light ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but I have often obſerved Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons in a fault herein, and by conſequence miſtake. Then band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age muſt be made, ſo as that the vein may fill, and be extended.</p>
                     <p>But in tying the fillet two things muſt be obſerved, which are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly neglected by many. The firſt is, that the hand (if the vein be to be opened in the Arm) be kept open till the fillet be tied as it ſhould: for ſo it afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Blood out the better, when it is tied. Another thing is, that when it is ſitted, the skin over the vein be neither drawn up (as moſt do) nor on one ſide, nor any other way out of its place. For this, when it returns to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, ſtops up the wound of the vein; and it returns again preſently, when the ſtring is but a little looſened. In Bodies where the veins are full of Blood, little skill ſerves the turn and every Boy is reckoned an Artiſt ſufficient: But in ſcarcity of Blood, or ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of veins, or when they lie deep, or are inconſtant, more skill is required, both to find out and know the vein, and to keep it, and alſo (which is the main thing) to open it right.</p>
                     <p>When the fillet is thus fitly tied, if the vein be eminent, or conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to ſight, or manifeſt to the touch, it muſt be opened as ſoon as there begins to be any reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it; for by tarrying it grows more obſcure, whereby the work is alſo rendred more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</p>
                     <pb n="617" facs="tcp:52816:322"/>
                     <p>The fitteſt place of Section is that which is ſafeſt, and moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. I call that ſafeſt, which is fartheſt from the Nerves and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; and that moſt patent, which is higheſt, and moſt manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>But when the fillet is tied, and the Limb a little rubbed, if the vein ſtill lie hid, recourſe muſt be had to hot cloaths, and ſomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of warm water: and if it be not found out by theſe, it will ſcarce appear by any other means. Wherefore the Lancet perhaps muſt not be thruſt in there; but ſome other adjoyning vein, if it be turgid, muſt be opened.</p>
                     <p>The narrowneſs of the orifice is holpen by inlarging the wound; and ſo the ſtoppage of it is holpen by removing of what ſtops it. But greater care is required in mending the narrowneſs, than if the vein had not been touched before: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Blood is continually dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed between the skin and the vein, which by forcing up the skin disjoyns it from the vein. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſoon as the skin at the wound riſes into a ſwelling, it muſt preſently be ſoftly preſſed with the Thumb, that the violence of the blood may be forced back, and the riſing ſwelling deproſt: Then the Thumb muſt by degrees be taken off a while, till the wound appears and gives room to the operating hand or inſtrument to operate. Then the Lancet muſt be gently and carefully put into the firſt Section, and the inciſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged as much, as the firſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was deficient. But great care muſt be taken in this operation, that only the skin be not (as it often is) dilated without the vein; becauſe then the labour would be to no purpoſe. The inſtrument therefore muſt be put again mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately into the cavity of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and the wound muſt be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enlarged according to Art. But if the return of the skin hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the efflux of Blood, it muſt be gently reduced into the ſame place, where it was when the vein was cut, that the diviſion of it and the vein may meet together, and it muſt be kept there, till as much blood is run, as you would have.</p>
                     <p>But it happens alſo, that the skin, or rather all that is over the vein, covers the wound of the vein, which nevertheleſs is not drawn out of its place; And this happens when the vein lies deep, and the Chirurgeon puts in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet too much ſlanting, and does not raiſe the point, but pulls it out the ſame way he put it in. When this happens, if you would make the Blood run (ſuppoſing the vein ſufficiently divided) you muſt with a very ſmall Probe or a pin's head, either raiſe the skin, or depreſs it a little, till the Blood runs as you would have it: for by this means, either the vein is a little ſeparated from the skin, or the skin from the vein, and way is made for the Blood.</p>
                     <p>When a ſufficient quantity of Blood is taken, and the fillet is looſed, and the vein on each hand ſoftly expreſſed, or exgurgitated (if I may uſe a Chirurgeon's word) that the lips of the wound may not gape, and may joyn the better, laying the Thumb of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring hand on one end of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (it is the beſt on the lower) the skin muſt be drawn according
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:52816:323"/>to the rectitude of the wound, and a ſmall pledgit of Lint or Cotton muſt be laid upon it, and neatly tied, that it may not bleed again afreſh, nor the Limb be pained by too ſtrait binding. But if it be difficult to ſtop the blood, either becauſe of its thinneſs (as when the blood is very ſerous) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the large orifice, then with the Thumb, the fore and middle Finger of the left Hand, the skin muſt be drawn to each extremity of the Section in a right line with the Section, and ſo the blood is ſtopt: or, if you liſt, the edges may be cloſed up by applying your Thumb and fore-Finger, not to the ends of the wound, but to the ſides: but the firſt way, if it can be done, is the beſt, and fitteſt for the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>When the blood is thus ſtopt, and the edges of the wound fitly joyned together, a bolſter of Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, or (which is ſafer) half a Bean, or (which is beſt of all) a piece of bole Armenick, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the form of half a Bean or half a hazle-Nut, may be laid upon the wound inſtead of a bolſter; which being covered with ſoft Lint or Cotton, muſt be ſo artificially bound on, that the too great aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hurt not, nor the too great laxity occaſion its bleeding again unawares. When theſe things are done, all bodily labour and motion of the Limb muſt be forborn. This our advice may be contemned by ſeveral; but certianly by ſuch as little regard their Patient's Life: for ſometimes it has been known, that People have died through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this very thing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince a Bean, or a bit of Bole is not of any ſuch weight of bulk, as to encumber a Chirurgeon much, no one ſhould be without them, who frequently lets blood.</p>
                     <p>And if an Artery chance to be cut, and it cannot be ſtopt the foreſaid way, nothing is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſafe for the Patient's ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to bring cloſe together, and exactly to joyn the edges of the Section, then to cover it with the foreſaid Bole, and carefully bind it, and then with the Hand gently and conſtantly to retain and preſs it till it grows together, and this cure muſt be uſed for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days.</p>
                     <p>We have already told you how to ſtop Blood, and how to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Venaefection, when it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amiſs, how many ways one may miſtake, and how miſtakes may be avoided. Now it remains to ſhew (a thing worth the while not to be ignorant of) how an unexpected cutting of an Artery or Nerve, and the pricking of a Tendon may be avoided: how many ways of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vein, how the Lancet ſhould be managed: and ſeveral other things.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore know that the veins, which Phyſicians order to be bled, have no where Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Nerves, or Tendons lying above them, nor lying at an equal height with them; but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them in ſeveral places, yet not in all, which (beſides the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance an Artiſt has from diſſecting dead bodies) is eaſily ſeen in the Hands, Feet, Hams, Arms, and other parts of living People. From whence it is evident, that he who pricks a Nerve or Tendon together with a Vein, muſt have run his
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:52816:323"/>Lancet in deeper, than was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to let blood; ſince to perform the buſineſs required, it had been ſufficient to have cut the upper part of the vein, next the Skin or one ſide of it, and not to have ſtab'd it through on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>A Nerve indeed, when in this caſe it is wounded, can hardly be diſcerned, before it is hurt, and there is not another in the whole body, that I know of, which is uſually hurt; beſides that, in the middle of the bent of the Arm, that lies under the common vein (or rather the Tendon of the <hi>muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus biceps.</hi>) But Tendons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their frequency and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, are oftner touched, but with leſs danger than when a Nerve is hurt. They are hurt ſometimes by chance, when the Lancet is run in too deep, and ſometimes when the Chirurgeon miſtakes, and pricks a Tendon for a Vein. And as there are ſome who miſtake a Tendon for a Vein, ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there are others, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when the Vein appears not to ſight, but only to touch, dare not open it, believing it to be a Tendon and not a Vein.</p>
                     <p>When therefore a Limb is tied, and the Vein is not apparent in the place, where it is uſually found, and ſome round thing is perceived deep under the skin, of which you doubt, whether it be a Vein or no, preſently looſe the fillet: for when it is looſe, the Vein will fall, and cannot be perceived again, till the fillet is tied. Therefore if what you felt, appear the ſame, both when the fillet is tied, and when it is looſe, you muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Lancet, ſince this muſt needs be no Vein, but a Tendon, or the head of a Muſcle, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſide a Vein. Wherever Arteries are, they beat; by which both their place and depth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to any Artiſt, who has but competent experience.</p>
                     <p>Swooning frequently happens in Blood-letting, which uſes to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to the by-ſtanders, yea, and to unexperienced Phyſicians more fear, than hurt to the Patients. Yet it happens through no fault of the Artiſt, but the faint-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Patient, which diſturbs the ſpirits in the Body, and checks them, which makes the Soul ſeem to depart. But this is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented; namely, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient lye along, and hold ſome liquor, as water or wine in his Mouth till the blood runs. And if notwithſtanding it ſeize one, ſtop the blood with your Thumb laid to the orifice, and preſently throw ſome cold water in his Face: If it continue longer, you may alſo pinch the Noſe; and when the fit is over, take off your Thumb, and take away what Blood in prudence you ſhall think ſit, but ſtop it not, as ſome over-timerous perſons are apt to do. If it take one ſitting, he muſt be helped the ſame way the other was to be preſerved from it: he muſt preſently lie on a Bed, or be gently laid on his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and have cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thrown in his Face, as was ſaid before: For an Artiſt may eaſily perceive it coming, if he look in the Patient's Face, or if he obſerve his Pulſe; for that is pale, and this alters its ſtroke. But as it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be perceived, and is raiſed on ſo ſlight occaſion; ſo neither is it
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:52816:324"/>hard to get off, nor when a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is ſeized by it, is it difficult for him to be reſtored to his Senſes, Thô at its coming it cauſe ſome terrible motions of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, quivering of the Eye-lids and Lips, and other things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet they are preſently over. Which is not ſo in Swoonings, which proceed from over emptineſs.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt ſpeak of the form of Section, and its manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. By the <hi>form</hi> I mean the manner of its poſition, and its magnitude. By this we call the Section either large, ſmall, or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: By the other, tranſverſe, or oblique, or length-way of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Long Section is better than tranſverſe. Oblique is the beſt, and eaſieſt to be performed. As to the manner of doing of it this way or that way, tho it may more eaſily be apprehended by once ſeeing the work well done, and the obſervation of it, than by ten times reading it with the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt voice; yet becauſe every Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cannot have an expert Maſter, and reading (well underſtood) is of ſome efficacy to direct the Hand, it will not be amiſs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn ſomewhat of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>The Limb being the way before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid tied with a Fillet, and the Vein appearing tenſe, either to the ſight or touch, it muſt preſently be opened with a well-pointed Lancet; not perpendicularly, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lance: in ſuddenly (as many do, who make more haſte than good ſpeed) but obliquely, and thruſting it in gently. When the Vein is perforated, the Lancet muſt not be drawn back the ſame way it went in: but ſuddenly the point muſt be raiſed, and the heel of the Lancet depreſſed, which Chirurgeons properly enough call <hi>elevation.</hi> And that you may do this the more commodiouſly, you muſt hold your Lancet at a good diſtance from the point, about the length of a long Bean; not that all of it ſhould be run in, but to perform the thing the better, which when it is taken too ſhort, cannot well be done. Beſides, it makes well for this thing, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hand, whilſt it operates, be not penſil, but ſupported by the reſt of the Fingers which hold not the Lancet, leaning on the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Limb.</p>
                     <p>A ſudden ſtroke is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, beſides that it often fails the Artiſt, it is in danger of hurting a Nerve or an Artery, becauſe there can be no aim or meaſure in a ſudden thruſt.</p>
                     <p>Now if an oblique pertuſion do not pleaſe you, the Vein may be opened length-way or tranſverſe. But as an oblique Section is prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all the reſt, ſo a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is worſe than any. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be called broad, when it is broader than is neceſſary for a free efflux of Blood. Strait, when it is ſtraiter than it ſhould, and in this ſome Tumor preſently ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And that is midling, by which, without either Tumor, or ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wound, the Blood paſſes freely.</p>
                     <p>That all theſe things ſhould be done as they ought, the Artiſt muſt be Ambidextrous, becauſe the Patient's right Arm and right Foot, and the left Temple require the left Hand, and the oppoſite
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:52816:324"/>parts the right. Yet all Veins may be opened, either with the right hand or with the left, if the Artiſt be but handy in either of them; thô not ſo commodiouſly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will become a good Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, to have both hands rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and well exerciſed, not only in opening of a Vein, but in any other buſineſs proper for a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, which can ſcarce well be done, when one Hand is uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>There are divers places in Man's Body, and many Veins, wherein Phyſicians adviſe Bleeding. In the Forehead, one at each Temple, which has often two branches, one in the middle of the Forehead, which has ſometimes two, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three branches. Behind the Ears, and at the Noſe by the great corner of the Eye. Sometimes bleeding at the tip of the Noſe by putting a Lancet about the depth of a Pumpion-ſeed between the cartilages, does good. Two under the Tongue. Two Jugulars, which ſometimes alſo have branches. Three in the bent of the Arm, of which the Baſilick or Hepatick Vein branches into ſeveral twiggs. In the left Arm this is called the Splenitick. The Cephalick has ſeldom any branches in the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The common ariſes from the Cephalick and Baſilick, it is called the Median, Purple and Black Vein. From this comes that they call <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis brachii,</hi> from which comes the <hi>Salvatella</hi> to the Ring-Finger, and another to the Thumb. One in the Yard, and ſometimes two. One at each Ham and each Ankle, where if they cannot be found, they muſt be ſought at their ends, namely towards the Toes on the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Foot. Of all theſe if that cannot be had, which is ſought for, the next muſt be taken, and of thoſe that are divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, the largeſt is to be choſen, except in the Jugulars.</p>
                     <p>The form and uſe of the fillet is the ſame, to demonſtrate and keep tight the Vein, in all parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Neck. Nor is the other obſcure, which is put about the Neck, for the Veins above the Breaſt. For the manifeſtation of which, a Towel is put about the Neck, and the ends of it brought forward, which are given into the Patient's Hand, and twiſted like a Cord, till the Veins appear: Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones breath is alſo good for this.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt treat of ſcarifying and Leeches. Scarification has one general cauſe, namely the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the part, where it is made. Therefore according to the magnitude of the Part, the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of the Burthen, the depth of that which ſhould be got out and its faultineſs, the wounds muſt be more frequent, deeper, larger, or ſtraiter, ſhallower and thinner: for thin, ſmall, and cutaneous ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications are proper for Diſeaſes, that lye not deep nor are grievous; but for ſtronger Diſeaſes, as for a Gangrene, other Scarifications are more ſuitable.</p>
                     <p>There is no part of the body but may be ſcarified, if either it be Gangrened, or troubled with an old Inflammation. Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſometimes uſed, where there is neither Gangrene nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, but where they are feared, as in venomous bitings and ſtings, ſuppoſe of the Aſpe, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:52816:325"/>or other venomous beaſts; for which nothing is better, than to make ſpeedy ſcarification upon the very ſting or bite, and near about it, making two, three, or at the moſt four wounds. In the ſtinging of a Scorpion, if there be but one pricle, one ſcarification made upon the prick is enough. In the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Aſps, becauſe they bite with ſeveral Teeth, or in other bites or ſtings, in which more than one print of a ſting or tooth is left, one may make a wound upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prick or bite. When there is neither Gangrene nor Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ſuſpicion of either, ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are uſed for derivation, with Cupping-glaſſes or Horns.</p>
                     <p>All ſcarifications are better made with a Raſor than with any other ſort of inſtrument: But with Cupping-glaſſes, the German Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet is the beſt.</p>
                     <p>The application of Leeches is not effectual enough for Gangrenes of the greater Limbs; thô it ſerves the turn well enough, when a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene invades the leſs parts of the Body, as the Ears, Noſe, Fingers, Yard, and the Piles either inward or outward; but ſcarifying is quicker and ſafer than Leeches: However, for ſoft and effeminate perſons (who are affrighted at the very name of an inſtrument) they are often uſed inſtead of the knife.</p>
                     <p>They will not ſtick unleſs the skin be clean, and free from filth and ill ſcent. Wherefore if they be to be applied to any part, where there has been an Ointment or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it muſt be clean wiped, ſo that it may reſemble nothing but pure fleſh. Sometimes a ſlight ſcratch is made, like that where Cupping-glaſſes are applied, that the ſenſe of the Blood there may make them ſtick. They will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſten in winter time, unleſs they be kept in a warm place.</p>
                     <p>They are kept in a glaſs, or earthen veſſel full of water, and well covered, that they get not out; but ſo as to admit the Air. They may be uſed at any time, namely, either the very day they are taken out of the River or Lake (unleſs they have been new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed; for then they would not readily ſtick) or when they have been kept ſeveral days. They will hold good for half a year, but el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are ineffectual, either through hunger or ſluggiſhneſs, or for ſome other reaſons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when you can renew them, it is better to do it every ſecond or third Month.</p>
                     <p>When a Leech is faſtned, it muſt be let ſtick, till it fall of it ſelf, or if it muſt be taken off ſooner, ſtrew a little Salt or Aſhes on it, and it immediately leaves the skin. If you would take away more Blood, than it can contain, ſnip the Tail with a pair of Sciſſers, and it will nevertheleſs ſuck Blood ſtill, which runs out at the wound: Yet it will fall off of it ſelf, or by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salt or Aſhes on its Back.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the couching of a Catarrhact.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Catarrhact is called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>Suffuſio,</hi> in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Arabians call it water, it is commonly called a Catarrhact, the denomination, as I ſuppoſe being taken from <hi>Catarrhacta</hi> a Portcullis, which being let down ſtops all paſſage. For a Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhact falling down from the Head into the Eyes, ſtops all paſſage of the light and viſion, whereupon the Patient afterwards grows blind.</p>
                     <p>This impediment is cauſed by a pituitous humor growing within the Eye like a tunicle, or a ſpeck, or drop, or film, or water, which appears like a white coat to them that look on it, and this is ſo, when it is confirmed; for in the beginning when it is growing, it looks not like a coat, but like ſmoke, or vapor, or a miſt; whence it comes to paſs, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various denſity of the humor, the Sight is hindred, as when one ſees through a thick Air and Smoak, or through a Miſt. The various poſition of the humor likewiſe makes a great difference; for thô it be always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Pupilla</hi> or ſight of the Eye, yet it is ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly againſt the middle, and the ſpace round about is free; then in the middle nothing is ſeen; but round, all things appear. In ſhort, according as the humor poſſeſſes this or that part of the Pupil, ſo the ſight muſt needs vary.</p>
                     <p>This humor grows in the Eye chiefly by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Eye, occaſioned by a fall or blow, or ſome other cauſe, that weakens the Eye, which ſince of its own nature it is cold, by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is made colder; wherefore no wonder if ſigns of coldneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appear in it, to wit, the breeding of a cold humor, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, denſity and obduration, I ſay, of a pituitous matter, which at length grows hard in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Eye, ſuch as is the aqueous humor, which <hi>Galen</hi> makes to be the excrement of the Eye, ſo that from what has been now ſaid, It appears why Phlegm becomes concrete in the Eye, and why in the aqueous humor, though there be various opinions in what part of the Eye exactly it does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal. <hi>Celſus l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 7. will have it grow between the two coats, the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> where he holds there is an empty ſpace, which I think not altogether ſo conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to truth. <hi>Paulus l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 21. holds it to be in the <hi>Membrana cornea,</hi> as appears from his own words, <hi>A Suffuſion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:52816:326"/>concretion of a ſuperfluous humor in the</hi> Membrana cornea <hi>near the Sight of the Eye,</hi> which I take to be falſe, thô <hi>Paulus</hi> ſays otherwiſe, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c. proprio,</hi> namely, that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhact is an effuſion of humors, which congeal between the <hi>Tunica ceratoides</hi> and the <hi>cryſtalloides. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len de uſu partum c.</hi> 1 &amp; 4. writes that it grows between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the Cryſtalline: which ſaying of <hi>Galen</hi>'s is ſo general, that by it we are no wiſer than we were. But it has been frequently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both by operators themſelves, and by ſuch as have looked on, when the needle has been put in backwards behind the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea tunica,</hi> that it has appeared before the Suffuſion; which perſwades me, that the Humor congeals at the hole of the <hi>Tunica uvea,</hi> or about its circumference, or a little behind it in the aqueous humor. But ſince the hole of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> is dilated, one would think, the concrete humor ſhould lye juſt behind the hole of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> becauſe if it grew in its circumference, it could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. However, this objection is anſwered by <hi>Paulus,</hi> who will have the ſuffuſed Eye preſt with the Finger, and if after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and motion the pupil be dilated, it is a ſign of no confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catarrhact; if it be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, it is a ſign it is confirmed, which it is convenient to know in order to a cure.</p>
                     <p>The beſt way of cure is by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, when it can be done; and it may well enough be done by them, when it is freſh, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly congealed. In this way of cure innumerable Medicines are found in Authors, called Eye-ſalves or <hi>Collyria;</hi> but all to no purpoſe, becauſe whether they be Powders, Liquors, or Ointments, the Eye has ſuch an averſion to them, that it will not ſuffer them to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or if it be forced to receive them, yet in the twinkling of it they are turned off; for the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eye cannot be hindred. All which things conſidered, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rings have been invented, to keep the Eye ſteady; but to no purpoſe: for the Eye would have its motion, and then the Medicines ſlipt off. At length it was found poſſible to keep Medicines on the Eye, thô it ſhould move. This is performed by a Glaſs veſſel, or Cupping-glaſs, whoſe mouth is juſt as big as the ball of the Eye: In this Liquors and Waters, and with them Powders may be put; and the Cupping-glaſs may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt with the Eyes ſhut, and then by degrees opening the lids; by this way it is experienced, that Medicines will tarry long on the Eyes, and do good. This is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe, whereby moſt diſeaſes of the Eyes may be cured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external or internal. Firſt of all, Cupping-glaſſes were uſed, which would let ſome of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors run out; but afterwards oblong Glaſſes were more exactly ſitted to the Eye, with Ears, through which ſtrings are put and faſtned behind the Head, And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Water, which is applied to the Eyes, ought to be lukewarm, to the end the cold may not offend the Eye, but may rareſy it, and cauſe the Medicine to penetrate, and ſince warm water evaporates, and the vapour not finding a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out, may draw the Eye, and
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:52816:326"/>bring humors thither; therefore the glaſſes were made with a pipe at the top, to let out the expiring vapor. And thus a moſt apt and convenient veſſel is invented, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep a thin and watry medicine to the Eye, whoſe contact the Eye will eaſily endure: It is alſo uſeful to put in more Liquors at, as by a Funnel. Among thoſe infinite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which are propoſed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for the cure of Suffuſions, this is one of the beſt, uſed in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid. It is this, <hi>Aqua eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragiae, chelidoniae, &amp; roſarum cum medico Aquae vitae primae diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> In this there is a diſſolving, attenuating, and penetrating facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are the main intentions in the propoſed caſe. So far the Medicinal part, now we proceed to the Manual operation.</p>
                     <p>When the Suffuſion is perfect, then all are for having it cured by Chirurgery, becauſe Medicines do but irritate the Eye, but do no good, becauſe of the concretion and hardneſs of the Suffuſion; whereas the Needle will do the work by couching it. But firſt, I ſay, the Cure muſt be tried by Medicines, while the Patient has ſome glimmering of Sight, as through Smoak, or a Vail, or Miſt: For if there be any further loſs of ſight, the Suffuſion is conſummate, wherein becauſe of the concretion of the Humors, and the thickneſs of the Membranes, the Sight is quite hindred, which can only be helped by Chirurgery. And this operation is one of the niceſt in the whole Art. In Latine it is called <hi>Catarrhactae depoſitio,</hi> in Engliſh Couching of a Catarrhact. For, as I ſaid, it ſo happens, that a Membrane or very thin pellicle, ſuch as comes upon Wine or Beer, does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtick to the inner part of the <hi>Tunica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> where the hole is, that we call <hi>Pupilla,</hi> or the Sight of the Eye, and it covers the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor, and hinders the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and the out-let of the rayes. This, when it has acquired a due conſiſtence, and is neither too flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, no: old and tough, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away and couched by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Needle. The Body therefore being purged, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Moon, on a clear and ſerene day, the Patient muſt be ſet on a ſeat in a clear place, againſt the light; over againſt him the Operator muſt ſit, but a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: A Servant muſt ſtand behind the Patient, and hold his Head immoveable. The ſound Eye muſt be bound up with a Ribband. And the Chirurgeon, after having chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little Fennel in his Mouth, muſt breath upon the Eye affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rub it a little with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and bid the Patient turn his Eye towards his Noſe. Then the Needle being often prickt into a flannel or woollen cloth, to make it warm, muſt be forced (with the right Hand, if the left Eye; and with the left, if the right be ill) at one thruſt through the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva,</hi> about the thickneſs of a Crown piece, juſt by the <hi>Iris,</hi> and by degrees, as it were by dril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and turning it round, muſt be got through the <hi>Cornea.</hi> When it is come to the empty ſpace, any who has but moderate skill, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſtaken, becauſe when he preſſes he feels no reſiſtence. Then the Needle muſt be inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuffuſion, and with its
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:52816:327"/>point muſt by little and little be ſeparated from the edge of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and then by turning it gently muſt be wrapped about it, and muſt be couched, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced beneath the region of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> to the outer corner of the Eye, till it ſtick there. When this work is done, the Needle muſt be drawn out gently, and the white of an Egg beaten up and mixt with Honey, to hinder Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be applied between two fine ſilks, and ſo the Eye muſt be bound up. After this, Reſt, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence; and a moiſt and cooling Diet will be proper.</p>

                     <p>THE next thing in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed method, which we are to treat of, is the Stone. And becauſe the extracting it, or inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, called Lithotomy, is an operation ſo difficult, that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> by his Oath, obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not to meddle with <hi>Lithoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> but to leave it to Men skilled in that operation: I think we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do better, than in our diſcourſe concerning it, to venture on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon our own Authority or Credit, but to relye wholly on them who have made it their main buſineſs to cut for the Stone. And thô ſeveral have writ on this ſubject; yet I ſhall only make uſe of what one of my Collegues, Dr. <hi>Groenevelt</hi> (of whoſe Lithotomical adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have been an Eye-witneſs, and of whoſe ſucceſs therein, not only I, but multitudes are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) has made publick on this ſubject.</p>

                        </gap>. And thô any diſeaſe in the Kidneys might properly enough be called <hi>Nephritis;</hi> yet ſince the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Stone cauſes the moſt exquiſite pain, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> peculiarly ſo called.</p>
                     <p>From what has been ſaid it is apparent, that by the word <hi>Stone</hi> we mean a hard Body, grown into the form of a Stone, eſpecially in the Kidneys and Bladder.</p>
                     <p>Here to be ſolicitouſly inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:52816:327"/>whether the Stone be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,, or the cauſe of a Diſeaſe, or a Symptome, would be fruitleſs: For theſe are but mere curioſities about the name, and in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect may be differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, I think, (thô <hi>Galen</hi> thinks otherwiſe) it can ſcarce be called a Diſeaſe, ſince it is no bad diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any part. It muſt be owned to be a cauſe, ſince it is apt to occaſion obſtruction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration, racking pains, and the like: And when it is voided, it may be reckoned among ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes.</p>
                     <p>What the ſubject of the Stone is, I ſuppoſe all Men know well enough, namely the Kidneys and Bladder, which, as if they were wombs deſigned for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are found pregnant with Stones, and are often delivered of them with moſt violent Throws. Here a queſtion may ariſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Stone be bred in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, from whence the Ureters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and in the <hi>Tubuli,</hi> or in the very <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Kidneys? I know not how to deny either, becauſe not only my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſeveral great Men's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, ſuch as <hi>Euſtachius, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtus,</hi> and others evidence the ſame. But it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Stone which is bred in the very ſubſtance of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, if it be of any bigneſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> without dilaceration, ſince the Caruncles, which Anatomiſts call the Mamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Proceſſes, and through which alone the paſſage lies, are ſo ſmall, that they will ſcarce admit a hair of ones Head. And what has been ſaid of the Stone in the Kidney, the ſame in a manner may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to wit, that it has two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; one in the cavity of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the midſt of the Urine, another in the ends of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, between the double coat of the Bladder, where falling ſmall from the Kidneys, it ſticks and ſometimes grows: For the Ureters are implanted in the Bladder not far from its Neck, and before they come into the cavity of the Bladder, do paſs the double Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of it a fingers breadth, in the ends whereof within the very duplicature of the Membrane a Stone ſometimes grows, not float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Cavity, but ſometimes firmly knit to the coats of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>Yet here we will not deny, but that Stones may grow in other parts of the Body, ſince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 5. <hi>Epid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received opinion, both among the Ancients and Modern, is, That the cauſe of the Stone in the Kidneys muſt be aſcribed ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only to the burning heat of the Kidneys. For they will have it, that thick, viſcous, pituitous, and tartarous excrements, as they call them, which they hold to be the material cauſe of its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for they aſſign a twofold cauſe, the material and formal,) are by little and little dried, and when the thin and moiſt parts are waſted, that they are converted into the form of a Stone; juſt as we ſee Chymiſts and Chirurgeons bake their medicamentous and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Stones out of ſeveral juices of Herbs and Minerals, by exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a gentle heat. But in how great difficulties this opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves Men, is apparent enough to all, but ſuch as veneration for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity has quite blinded: for does not daily experience ſhew, that Stones are bred in old Men, in phlegmatick Women, and in others of a cold Conſtitution? See <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aph.</hi> 31. They far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urge; If a viſcous and tough Matter may by the heat of a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace be hardned into ſo hard and ſtony a matter, why may not a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous matter he hardned into a Stone, by the preternatural heat of the Body? I Anſwer, Firſt, is any mortal able to endure ſuch a heat in his Body, as the heat of an Oven is, which is required to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the viſcous Matter to ſo great a hardneſs? Secondly, is the caſe the ſame with the Stone, which is drowned in Urine, and with Bricks which are dried in a red hot Kiln? If Stones were bred only by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat, (as ſome are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they would diſſolve again in water; as we ſee Clay, dried in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat, diſſolves, if it be wet again. If they came from heat, Fevers Continual, Symptomatical, Habitual, and I may ſay <hi>Maraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moides,</hi> would enſue. And this Quirk gives but little ſatisfaction, <hi>An intenſe heat is perceived here,</hi> ſince the heat does not precede the Stone, but does occaſionally ariſe from it, as we find heat, when a Thorn is got into the Finger, but the Thorn is not cauſed there by the heat.</p>

                     <p>That arenous and calculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Kidneys, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> and moſt of his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents inſiſt upon, if you will give it a favourable interpretation, may be allowed, underſtanding by it not a certain occult quality, and lapidifick virtue (which ſome would make fiction of) differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the manifeſt cauſes; but rather an over-ſtraitneſs of the Pores, and it may be of the little veſſels which are in the Kidneys, and through which the Urine ought naturally to be tranſcolated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one hath it ſo from the day of his birth, thither alſo we refer an hereditary diſpoſition to the Stone; or that as he grows in years, he gets it by the <hi>res non naturales,</hi> as they are commonly called; for we may eaſily imagine, that this leſs moveable and agitated matter, ſince it is groſs and of an earthy nature, whenever it finds the ways ſtrait, through which it ought to have an open paſſage, is apt to ſtop, (Of this we have a familiar inſtance in the churning of Butter, where on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by agitation the Butter is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſerous part of the Milk, becauſe the particles of the Butter are leſs apt for motion than thoſe of the <hi>Serum.</hi> The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Des Cartes Princip.

                     <p>As to the Stone in the Bladder, whoſe generation differs not from the formation of the former, we have no difficulty to ſtruggle with; only we may obſerve, that it has not always its riſe in the Bladder; but ſometimes owes its rudiment to the Kidneys. About three years ſince we took two Stones from a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain boy, and when we had ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether there were any more Stones in the Bladder, we found none: Two days after a third came out at the wound, the Boy was tormented with continual pain, and want of ſleep, ſo that being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a vomiting, a continual Fever, Looſeneſs, and ſuch like ſymptomes, he at length expired. We diſſected him, and found the <hi>Pelvis</hi> of the right Kidney full of divers Stones, and the Ureter as wide as a ſmall Gut. But to our buſineſs, a Stone grown in the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli</hi> or the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and ſometimes a little one in the very <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Kidneys paſſing the canal of the Ureter, when at the end thereof it comes to the ſtraits between the duplicature of the Bladder, it may ſometimes ſtick, and there ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that Cavity, thô it can ſcarce hinder the paſſage of the thinner and more ſlippery Particles, yet it retains the groſſer, and being thus increaſed, does often ſtick ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt to the coats of the Bladder,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:52816:329"/>and breeds a ſecondary Stone (if I may ſo call it) therein: The ſame we ſuppoſe may be done in the cavity of the Bladder. For if a ſmall Stone of the Kidneys find paſſage through that narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, we mentioned; and if it be detained in the Cavity, when it is not voided by the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an increaſe through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual appoſition of new matter in manner aforeſaid. As to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Stone of the Bladder, as they call it, I have no occaſion to add much, ſince we muſt acknowledge the efficient and material cauſes to be the ſame with thoſe of the Stone in the Kidneys; nor do they differ in any thing except in the ſubject. Yet ſome cannot chuſe but admire, what way a Stone can be formed in the midſt of that flood of Urine, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one ſhould think a diſſolution of the Stone muſt rather be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, (whereby perhaps <hi>Fernelius</hi> was enclined to derive all the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Stone from the Kidneys) but the wonder will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ceaſe, if one have ever ſeen the tophous concretions, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the perfect Stones, which grow upon the Sea-ſhoar and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Banks, not unlike the Stones that are formed in humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>The remote and mediate cauſes, by means whereof a calculous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is communicated to the maſs of Blood and the Kidneys, are intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and a diſorderly way of living; for exceſs in eating alone, as in Children, is ſufficient to afford matter for the Stone. Becauſe it often ſo happens, that through this exceſs, abundance of Humors flowing through ſo many veſſels, the Glands being filled beyond meaſure, and the paſſages of the Chyle being either obſtructed or compreſſed, the publick coction is much endammaged; or there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gathering of corrupt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſied Juyces, the Meſentery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſeat of ſlow Fevers and ſtubborn diſeaſes. And this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt maſs does not only occaſion an intemperature of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but it alſo cauſes an ill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Organs, breeds matter for the Stone, weakens the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, extinguiſhes its ſpirituous ſerment, and gives riſe to ſoure belchings, fluctuations and rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the Guts. Such a food I account Bread, not well fermented nor well baked, to be; and Cheeſe, which is hard of concoction, breeds ſowre belchings and wind, it can ſcarce enter the paſſages of the chyle out of the Guts through the lacteal veins, it breeds obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it makes the Blood tough, and out of its terrene ſalt breeds the the Stone. Hereby I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to ſtrong, found, and luſty Men, whoſe Affairs will not admit of a Medical way of living. To ſuch (becauſe according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates, Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 50. <hi>Things to which one has been accuſtomed, thô worſe, uſe to giveleſs diſturbance, than things to which one has not been accuſtomed,</hi> or becauſe cuſtome is a ſecond Nature) I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the beſt ſort of Cheeſe in moderation. Beef, Pork, Goats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh, pickled, and ſmoak-dried Meats, are hard of concoction, and afford an earthy juice. Ducks, Geeſe, and other Water-Fowl breed ſuperfluities and excrements. To
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:52816:330"/>theſe you may add all Pulſe, raw Herbs, boiled Wheat, and Rice, unleſs they be mixt with inciders and detergents. Hard Eggs, ſtony Pears, Crabs, Cornelian Cherries, Medlars, and ſuch like Fruits, of a groſs and auſtere nature, ſtraiten the paſſages very much, and afford an exceeding thick juice. Sharp Spices, as Pepper, Ginger, Cubebs and Muſtard are bad. Among Drinks apt to breed the Stone theſe are of the number, new Beer, and too much hopped; for Alder boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in large Coppers with Hops, and covered with Sand in a Cellar for three years turns to a hard Stone, of which we make the beſt Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to ſharpen Anatomica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alſo ſweet Ale, foggy and not fermented, thick and fenny water, or of melted Ice, and any that has a remarkable taſte, which argues the nature of the place whence it comes, and brings along with it the virtues of Alume, Sulphur, Iron and the like, and therefore ought not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merely Drink, but medicated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Drinking cold water is bad for ſuch as ſweat after labour. Wine that is red, troubled, ſweet, the Moravian, Hungarian, Cretian, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Malmſey and Spaniſh, in which a ſaline tartar never fails, gets into all the veſſels of Man's Body, ſticks to the Kidneys and Joynts, and breeds knots and ſtones. For in Wine there is a thick ſubſtance, which in tract of time ſticks to the ſides of the veſſels, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tartar, which is found in a great quantity in Rheniſh Wine, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes much hurt. But it is not the groſs Tartar alone that breeds the Stone; for beſides the Water and Tartar in Wine there is a Spirit, from whence all Wine has its ſtrength, as the Auſtrian Wines have leſs Tartar than Rheniſh, yet they do more miſchief; and no wonder, becauſe Spirit of Wine is nothing but Tartar reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Principles; for this Spirit conſiſts of a little Oil, much acid, and a volatil Spirit, which is the reaſon why tartariſate Spirit of Wine is far ſtronger than ſimple Spirit. And hence alſo a reaſon may be given, why Spirit of Wine, and ſeveral generous Liquors fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the breeding of the Stone.</p>
                     <p>And beſides Meat and Drink, the reſt of the <hi>res non naturales</hi> breed the Stone.

This conſiſts chiefly in a weakneſs of the expulſive faculty, and in an innate fault of the Blood.

But whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Stars be able to effect ſo much in our Bodies, I ſubmit to better judgments.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the differences of Stones, they are various and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly diſtinguiſhed. In regard of quantity, a Stone is ſaid to be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large or ſmall. In reſpect of colour, red, yellow, aſh-coloured or black. This diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours depends on the external fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the concurring Particles, or on ſome extraneous Matter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied, as <hi>Pus,</hi> Blood, or Slime. In reſpect of the Figure it is round, oblong, (ſuch an one as I lately took from a Noble Counteſs's Son in this Land, in the preſence of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctors of Phyſick) Angular, Triangular, Quadrangular, or ſlat. But the various figure of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies is owing either to chance, or motion, or to the ſite of the adjoyning parts: hence the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der breeds round ones, the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters oblong ones, and ſome ſeem to reſemble exactly the cavity of the <hi>Pelvis</hi> of the Ridneys. Yet the principal differences are taken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Subject, hence it is called either the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or Bladder; or from the Matter, which is either thinner or thicker, whereof there be four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, Sand, Gravel, Tophus, and the Stone. 1. Sand differs from the Stone only in Magnitude, and it receives its minute ſhapes in the pores of the Kidnies, which (as
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:52816:331"/>
                        <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſays) gathering together and cementing makes up the Stone. 2. Gravel, which has its riſe from coagulated Sand with a <hi>Mucus.</hi> 3. A <hi>Tophus,</hi> thô it has the form of a Stone, and is larger than Gravel; yet it is ſofter and more friable or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ttle. 4. The Stone properly ſo called is ſolid, hard, and firm as a Rock, And the more plenty there is of a ſaline and earthy Matter, and the more exactly this is petrified, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Stone is; and the ſofter, when otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thô properly there be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomonick ſigns of the Stone in the Kidnies; they being aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, and common to other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; yet theſe following may be obſerved in Practice, as diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it moſt. 1. A fixt and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain in the region of the Loins; and this is dull, and cauſes a ſenſe of weight, when the Stone is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very <hi>Parenchima</hi> of the Kidnies, it being endued with a dull ſenſe; but when it is got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head of the Ureter, the pain is ſharp, cutting, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruel. Not many years agon a Patient, who was ill of a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Urine, for he voided none but what he vomited, and that had an Urinous ſmell, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakened by it. He conſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kidney could do its office, and ſo he died. 2. There is a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſtooping, the Nerves or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles of the Spine being thereby compreſſed and diſtended. 3. A very troubleſome pain in the Back. 4. A numneſs of the Thighs and Leg on the ſame ſide, becauſe of the compreſſion (by the weight of a great Stone) of the Muſcle called <hi>Pſoa,</hi> or of the Nerve that is branched out into all the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles of the Thigh. 5. A retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Teſticle on the ſame ſide with the Kidney affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the drawing up of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which proceed from the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to the Teſticles. 6. Reaching and Vomiting, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Kidneys with the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, not ſo much by means of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> (as ſome would have it) of whole Membrane each participates, as becauſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nerve, from the Stomachich branch of the ſixth pair, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the proper and inner coat of the Kidneys. 7. Urine often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bloody, the little Veins; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the ſubſtance of the Kidneys, being torn and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the attrition of the ſharp Stone: And ſometimes about the beginning, the Urine, comes thin, watry, and in a ſmall quantity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the obſtruction of the Kidney by the Stone: but when it paſſes through the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters</hi> into the Bladder, then a thick, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and watry Urine is voided. 8. I would have this accounted a main ſign of the Stone, when Stones or Gravel are voided by Urine, (which do not ſtick to the ſides of the pot, but preſently ſink to the bottom) whereupon the
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:52816:331"/>Patient finds ſenſible eaſe. And becauſe the Stone and Colick are ſo much alike, that not only an Emperick, but even a rational Phyſician may be miſtaken; I would have theſe marks of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction well obſerved. If the pain be above the Kidneys, it belongs not to the Kidneys, but to the Bowels. The pain of the Stone tends outwards, nor does it ever depart from that one place, unleſs the Stone be diſplaced and ſlip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter.</hi> The Colick wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, changes place, runs through all the Guts, and comes down to the Twiſt. Thoſe that have the Stone are better after Eating, and thoſe that have the Colick are worſe.</p>

                        <hi>Hippocrates lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Morb.</hi> does thus recount the ſigns of the Stone in the Bladder. When he would plſs, he is afflicted with pain, and his Urine dribbles from him as in the Strangury, it is bloody, when the Bladder is exulcerated by the Stone, or inflamed. But this ſign is not very manifeſt; however, the end of the Prepuce ſhews it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he piſſes Gravel. Boys trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Stone rub and pull their Privities. But ſince theſe ſigns are a little obſcure, I will produce other circumſtances, that in ſo difficult a caſe the truth may better appear. 1. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when the Stone is but little, the Party troubled with the Stone, after making water, feels a dull pain in his <hi>Glans,</hi> which pain paſſes from the <hi>Glans</hi> along the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter,</hi> to the Bladder, juſt as if he had the Strangury. For thô the Stone be but little, yet by its aſperity it pricks the neck of the Bladder, and ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a pain in the <hi>Glans,</hi> which pain returns from the <hi>Glans</hi> to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He that is troubled with the Stone does always in a manner, but eſpecially when he is about to make water, rub the end of his yard with his fingers, ſqueeze and draw it; hence it is, that Children troubled with the Stone have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways their hands on their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by plucking their yard, make it as long again as uſual. 3. If the Stone be heavy, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty finds a heavy pain, juſt as if there were a weight hanging at the bottom of his Belly between the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> which preſſed them down; beſides, he then finds a pain about his Navil, becauſe the bottom of the Bladder is joyned to the Navil by the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus.</hi> 4. If the Stone does not quite obſtruct the paſſage of the Urine, Nature is often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated to diſcharge the Urine, but in vain; ſometimes a little comes away; ſometimes, whether he will or no, away it comes, but with pain all the time. 5. Turning the Heels upwards and the Feet to the ground, it often happens, that the Stone ſlips back to the bottom of the Bladder, and the Urine finds a free paſſage. 6. Out of the Fit, we often ſee him that is afflicted with the Stone ſitting croſs-legged; for by that means the Stone is in ſome meaſure raiſed from the neck of the Bladder, ſo that the Urine has a free paſſage. 7. The Urine being kept, and grown ſharp and hot, by the exceſs of pain which it cauſes, draws ſpirits to the yard, and ſo the virite member both in
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:52816:332"/>Children and adult Perſons is erect, not out of any Venereal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or Luſt, as otherwiſe one would be apt to think. 8. From the conſent of the <hi>Anus</hi> and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe of the communion and connexion of Nerves, which they receive from the ſame branch, the calculous Perſon has both a motion to go to ſtool, and to make water at the ſame time. But theſe irritations are in vain; and if any thing be voided, it is but little, and with great pain. In Infants there is often a violent fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the Arſe-Gut. 9. Moſt calculous Perſons are continually athirſt, and often deſire much drink: for thô they void but a little Urine at once, yet becauſe they make water often, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a great deal, and ſo the <hi>Scrum</hi> of the Blood is waſted, which Nature endeavors to ſupply, ſo as ſhe may keep the inwards in that due temperament and ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By reaſon alſo of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual pains, watching and inquic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ariſe, the ſalt part in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is made ſharper, and the maſs of Blood grows hotter every day than other, which requires much and frequent cooling: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Jaundice, Dropſie, or ſome ſuch diſeaſe does enſue upon it. 10.

For it behoves a Man to know theſe things exactly. Here alſo the antecedent cauſes fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, namely, of what complexion the Patient is, what his Diet has been, and what Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes he has had; for without doubt he muſt have had cruel pain, if the Stone be great, hard, and uneven. Moreover, thô it be neceſſary to know, whether Stones be encloſed in a bag, and by it ſtick to the Membrane of the Bladder, yet it is very difficult, unleſs by ſearching with a <hi>Catheter</hi> or the Finger. And thus having briefly examined the Diagnoſticks, we now proceed to the Prognoſticks.</p>
                     <p>Children, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays 6. <hi>Epidem.</hi> are moſt ſubject to the Stone in the Bladder, and old Men to the Stone in the Kidneys. And <hi>Aph.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 61 Diſeaſes of the Kidneys and Bladder are difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured in old Men. A diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Stone from Parents to Children, through ſome primige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial taint in the Seed does clude all Medicine, be it never ſo generous, whether intended for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cure; which made <hi>Aretaeus</hi> think it a thing much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult by the help of Art, to hinder the Kidneys and Bladder from breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stone, when they have a
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:52816:332"/>diſpoſition to it, than to prevent a fruitful womb from conception. The Stone in the Bladder in reſpect of Medicines is more difficult to cure than that in the Kidneys; but in regard of Chirurgery, it is much eaſier; however ſometimes, the pain tending outwards to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles of the Spine, and an abſceſs ariſing, it has been known that Stones have been diſcharged that way, and the Ulcer has been heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Stone is a violent and dangerous evil, cauſing Inſlamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exulcerations, cruel Pains, Watchings, Fevers, ſtoppage of Urine, and other moſt violent Symptomes. If the Stone be not great but ſmall, not in a Body ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectick, nor abounding with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors apt to breed the Stone, and if the diſpoſition to it be not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, we may draw a good Prognoſtick thence; if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a bad one. If the Stone be conſiderably large and hard, the Patient muſt of neceſſity, if he will be eaſed of it, ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chirurgical operation, thô it be hazardous. But if the Stone be of an unuſual bigneſs and weight, ſuch an one as at the opening of one who died of it near <hi>St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Hoſpital, I took out, which weighed nineteen ounces and three drachms, ſuch are to be eſteemed deſperate, and muſt not be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, while they live. They that have the Stone incloſed in a coat, or without one, and ſticking to the Membrane of the Bladder, are in the ſame predicament, as alſo are old Men, and young Children alſo, if they be infirm. On the contrary, if the Patient have ſtrength, if he have good <hi>Viſcera,</hi> if the Stone be not too big, though he have ſeveral, yet through GOD's aſſiſtance, the operation may be courageouſly undertaken, and good ſucceſs may be expected. Stones in Women are voided and extracted with better ſucceſs and ſecurity, than in Men, becauſe they have a ſhort and wide paſſage for their Urine.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in reference to the Theory being premiſed, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to ſuch things as may be produced from Practice, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Cure, in order to prevent the invaſion of the enemy, and to beat him out again, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
                     <p>To perform this methodically, we have a threefold care upon us. Firſt, that the cauſes which are any way able to breed the Stone may be removed, and that ſo its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and encreaſe may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Secondly, that when the Stone is bred, it may be got out. Thirdly, that the Symptomes, the cruel pain may be aſſwaged, and the difficulty of Urine which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attends it, may be kept off. Theſe things may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by means taken from Diet, Pharmacy and Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>In the prevention we muſt firſt of all take care, that the bad Diet before-mentioned among the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Stone be avoided; and on the contrary, that a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one be made uſe of. Meats therefore muſt be uſed which are eaſy of digeſtion, afford little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, and have an attenuating and inciding virtue. To this end Mutton or Capon-broth, boiled
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:52816:333"/>with Chervil, Sorrel, Barley, and the like, eſpecially in Spring time, are very proper. And if Sobriety and Moderation be requiſite in any diſeaſe, it is in this,</p>
                     <q>Illud quod medium eſt, atque inter utrumque, probatur.</q>
                     <p>Moreover, the paſſions of the Mind muſt be ſo moderated, that their exceſs do no prejudice to the Body.</p>
                     <p>Now we proceed to the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate matter, that is, the load of crude and groſs humors impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently gathered by a diſorderly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or from ſome other cauſe, which that it may not get to the Kidnies, muſt be revelled and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated; to which end it will be proper to give Purges, ſuch as <hi>Manna, Caſſia, Diaprunum, &amp;c.</hi> Repeated vomiting alſo is good, (eſpecially for ſuch as are made for vomiting, and who perceive great crudities in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction) which if it come of it ſelf, muſt by no means be checkt; if not, Medicines muſt be given to provoke it; for by means of it a noxious humor gathered in the Body is often ſucceſsfully carried off, and Revulſion is forthwith made, ſo that it falls not on the Kidneys. But if any ſuch like Matter be gotten into the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, it muſt preſently be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by means of Diureticks. For this Intention, Turpentine, and Medicines prepared out of it, are proper. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, how a certain Monk by the uſe of it was cured of the Stone and Gout. The famous <hi>Bevaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicins</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Stone mentions an excellent preparation out of <hi>I evinus Lemnius;</hi> ſtrong French White-wine, having red hot Flints often quenched in it, expels the tartarctis Matter out of the Kidnies, before it grows to a Stone. Alſo Mineral waters, <hi>Timbridge</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> beyond Seas are excellent, becauſe they have an inciding, attenuating, opening, diſſolving and abſterſive virtue, Bathing alſo the Body in River water up till above the Loins, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes evacuation of Gravel, before it grows into a Stone, eſpecially if ſome proper Purge be given the day before, and the ſame day, if ſome ſpeciſique Diuretick be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>The next ſcope in curing is, to diſcharge the Stone, when bred. Yet here we muſt conſider, that if there be a large Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, it ought not to be removed, but if there be a ſmall one, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Cavity, it muſt be got out quickly: For when a large Stone is got into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> by the violence of pain that attends it, it often cauſes Convulſions, and Swoonings, ſo that if the pain be not quickly aſſwaged, as well by internal Remedies, as external Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, the Patient ſometimes periſhes. But before a little Stone be removed, Clyſters muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which may mollify and ſmooth the ways, by which it is to paſs, To which end <hi>Henry</hi> IV. King of <hi>France</hi> did often take a <hi>Bolus</hi> of freſh Butter and Sugar-candy, drinking after it a glaſs of ſmall Wine. Some commend Oil of Sweet Almonds, or Oil-Olive, <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:52816:333"/>fiſtula,</hi> and fat Broths, drunk in large quantities. Phyſicians do with great ſucceſs preſcribe molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Clyſters, made of emollient Herbs and Roots, adding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Diureticks, or only Oil of Chamaemel, Lilies, Sweet Almonds, <hi>&amp;c. Avicen</hi> believes, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated injection of Clyſters eaſes Nephritick pains. Externally they apply Cataplaſms made of Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Fomentations of the ſame, to which they add coolers, leſt pains might be exaſperated. They alſo uſe Oil of Sweet Almonds, and of Scorpions, with ointment of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, for a liniment. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent alſo, that bathing in freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with emollient Herbs, adding things alſo that are good to break the Stone, is a moſt effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make lax the paſſages. Theſe things being done, Medicines are further preſcribed to help the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stone, ſuch as are, all that provoke Urine, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Diureticks, of which you may find a copious Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue in Authors, and therefore I ſhall forbear naming them. But we uſe to add to theſe, Anodynes, and leſt any inconcocted Matter ſhould be carried to the Kidneys, we a little before give ſome gentle Purge. And if this method does not diſlodge the Stone, when bred, as in other caſes, ſo in this, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt remedies muſt be tried, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Vomit muſt be preſcribed: For by this means all the lower parts are exceedingly preſt, and things are expelled, which could not by any former means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But we muſt remember to add ſpeciſique Diureticks to our Vomits.</p>
                     <p>When the Stone is big, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have already ſaid, that we may not remove it, now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that we ſay what we may do. Whether in nature any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are to be found, which perfectly diſſolve the Stone, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe diſpute, and are at daggers drawing about it. If the Stone be brittle, of a looſe and ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and coagulated of <hi>Mucus</hi> and Sand, it is evident by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience, that ſuch an one may be broke and waſted. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi> and <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> do for this purpoſe greatly commend Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, and the Chymiſts their Salts of Reſt-harrow, Millet, Bean-ſhells, Salt of Egg-ſhells, Salt of Urine, of the Stone taken out of a Man, of Juniper, Aſh, volatil Salt of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Medicine made of <hi>Millepedes</hi> ſeems to excell all the reſt, for which conſult <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> I am certainly convinced by experience, that Spirit of Nitre does eaſily diſſolve the Stone, when it is taken out of Human Bodies, to the admitation of the beholders. If there has been a calculous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition lodged in the very Seed and menſtruous Blood, no cure by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine muſt be uſed, but only by Diet. For the whole foundation of Health is laid as it were in the Conception, and the good or bad Principles of the future ſtate of Health are thence derived to the off-ſpring.</p>
                     <p>The next Indication is anſwered, if the violent pain (the true rack and torment of Man,) be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is commonly done with one trouble by the Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed to lubricate the ways; and if theſe prote ineffectual,

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter</hi> of the ſame ſide. But now to our buſineſs; Difficulty in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king water oftentimes occaſions great trouble in this caſe, to avoid which both Diureticks inwardly (but with great caution) and lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments outwardly of Ointment of Marſh-mallows, Oil of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inonds and the like; as alſo Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Cataplaſms, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to this end, may be uſed. But if it ſo happen that the Stone get into the neck of the Bladder, and ſo hinder the paſſing of the Urine, it muſt by lying on ones Back, with the Legs high, and by ſhaking the Body, be removed thence; and at length, if this will do not good, it muſt be forced back into the Bladder with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter.</p>
                     <p>The Dimetick and Pharmaceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick remedies being thus briefly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, it remains now that we diſcourſe of the laſt remedy, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Chirurgick. We judge that letting of Blood, if there be a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thera,</hi> or an exceſſive Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, may be of uſe. I have often by experience found that Cupping-glaſſes ſet to the Loins, have in a Nephritick Fit brought down one or more Stones into the Bladder. If the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be too big to be expelled, nor for want of a requiſite Medicine can be diſſolved; if the violence of the diſeaſe will yield to no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, then a deſperate diſeaſe muſt have a deſperate cure. Here I cannot chuſe but laugh at Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks and Empericks, who brag, how they can break the Stone in the Bladder by giving Medicines inwardly; of whoſe fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts I could give you plentiful inſtances. But at length we are come to the laſt remedies, and if we will uſe them, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Cotting (of which <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, Schultetus, Hildanus, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Celſus</hi> and others have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) But for ſome days before, the Body muſt be prepared by Diet,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:52816:334"/>he muſt eat but little, and that wholſome food and not glutinous; among other things let him uſe exerciſe, to the end the Stone may come further down to the neck of the Bladder, as <hi>Celſus</hi> adviſes. When we are certain of the thing, the body muſt for a day or two before be kept with a low Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and then the Cure muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in a warm place, which may be performed divers ways. The firſt is called the <hi>Apparatus minor.</hi> All things therefore being in readineſs, the fore and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Finger of the left hand muſt be put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> and with the right the lower Belly muſt be preſſed towards the Bladder, (avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent compreſſion in the caſe, which might occaſion cruel pain, Inflammation, yea, and a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,) whence it comes to paſs, that the Bladder being ſqueezed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow room, the Stone may the better be taken hold of, which being taken hold of, inciſion muſt be made in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> upon the Stone, and if the Stone be ſmall, it may be thruſt out with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but if large, it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with an hook. Here we muſt make no more haſte than good ſpeed, for when the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is hurt, it cauſes diſtention of the Nerves, with danger of death. The ſecond way is <hi>Hildanus</hi>'s, which is performed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; all things being in readineſs, the Operator puts in his <hi>Catheter</hi> (I mean not ſuch an one as we uſe for ſuppreſſion of Urine; but one that has a furrow or hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, ſuch an one as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in <hi>Paraeus l.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 44.) upon the Stone, then with a Razor half wrapt up he makes inciſion to the <hi>Catheter;</hi> afterwards upon the <hi>Catheter</hi> he puts into the wound a Director; that the Yard may be free, he takes out the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter;</hi> with the Director, if there be occaſion, he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ates the wound, and then by the ſide of the Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or he puts in his ſcoops, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Director, and putting his Finger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> he takes hold of and extracts the Stone with a hook, either whole, or piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, if it be either large or brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The third way is, when the wound is made in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and he puts a <hi>Forceps</hi> upon the Director; he takes out the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, takes hold of the Stone, and ſo extracts it, this way is of uſe, when it cannot be gotten out with an hook. The fourth way of operation is called the <hi>Franconine Lithotomy,</hi> from its. Author <hi>Peter Franc,</hi> which is performed in this manner; Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Lithotomiſt meddles not at all with the extraction of the Stone unleſs it appear in the wound, but binds up the wound after the uſual manner. After a few days (except the Stone come away out at the wound, of its own accord, which <hi>Peter Franc</hi> the Author of this invention ſays, in his practice has often befell him,) he endeavors to extract the Stone, which opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to have place, when the Patient is very weak, as <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> judges. The fifth way is, when the Stone is ſo big that it cannot paſs by a wound made in the neck of the Bladder, unleſs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the membranous ſubſtance of the Bladder, or its <hi>Sphincter</hi> be
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:52816:335"/>hurt. This, the Author <hi>Peter Frane</hi> does not propoſe for any Man to imitate; He only did it in a deſperate caſe at the requeſt of the Child's Parents, upon which he performed the Operation. The Patient was a Child of two years of age, who had a Stone in his little Body, as big as a Hen's egg, (the Author would have it obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this operation has no place in adult perſons,) he made Section in the Groin, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made in a Caeſarean Birth, and ſo cut the bottom of the Bladder, and extracted the Stone. The Child, thô he was much weakened, recovered, and the wound was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Hildanus</hi> alſo, in his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, mentions ſuch another example. The ſixth and laſt way is performed by an inſtrument, which <hi>Hildanus</hi> invented; Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he puts his inſtrument through the wound upon the Stone; this, when it is put in, may be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (like the inſtrument which we call <hi>Speculum matricis</hi>) after dilatation, the Operator endeavors to take hold of the Stone, and to extract it, when taken hold of. The famous Lithotomiſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> called <hi>Collet,</hi> cut ſeveral very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully this way; from a curious inſpection of whom, and of others likewiſe, the Author of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe has made ſuch proficiency, that among the reſt he has adventured on this way of operation, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continues to practiſe it. In the Female Sex, whether the Party be a Maid or Married, one may with far leſs trouble, and without Section or much effuſion of Blood undertake and perform this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Becauſe the orifice of the Bladder occurs preſently to ſight in the <hi>Pudendum;</hi> it is ſufficient to put in a <hi>Catheter,</hi> and below its furrow to put in a Dilator, and then to extract the Stone with a <hi>Forceps.</hi> Sometimes nevertheleſs, becauſe of the over-bigneſs of the Stone, a ſmall inciſion muſt be made in the orifice of the Bladder, from which and a too violent dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there is danger leſt the <hi>Sphincter</hi> ſhould be hurt, and an involuntary emiſſion of Urine ſhould follow.</p>
                     <p>Now it remains, the Stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extracted, that we diſcourſe, in what manner the Patient muſt be treated. He muſt not preſently be put to bed. If his Body be ſtrong, the Blood may be ſuffered to run a while, that the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be leſs. Then he muſt ſit in a Semicupe, ſo that he be up in it from his Ruees to his Navel, (all elſe muſt be covered with Cloths,) to the end his bleeding may be ſtopt. In a weak Body the Haemorrhage muſt immediately be ſtopt, ſometimes a Cupping-Glaſs muſt be ſet to the Groin and Hips, and to the <hi>Pubes,</hi> if the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be ſtopt; which when it is ſtopt, the Patient muſt be laid on his back in bed. In the mean time the lower Belly from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to the Loins, and the Privities alſo, muſt be well anointed with proper Oyls, made a little warm.

If a Lipothymy ſupervene, it may be removed by Cordials, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may be laid quietly to reſt, which unleſs it come of itſelf, muſt be promoted by moderate Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes. And thus, if ſtrength will permit, (<hi>Celſus</hi> expreſly ſays it,) within four and twenty hours, he muſt be ſet again in the bath, and as he is able he muſt tarry in it; and if he ſweat, he muſt be wiped with a Spunge. In the mean while, if ſleep be kindly, breathing free, if the Tongue be moiſt and thirſt little, if he goes well to ſtool, and but moderate pain with a ſmall Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, you may be certain the cure will ſucceed well. Finally, as much as is poſſible, we muſt endeavour, both in regard of Meat and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that Nature, which ſupplies the moſt wholſom Balſam, may be ſtrengthned, and ſo the Wound may be healed.</p>
                     <p>And now, all things belonging to the Stone in the Kidneys and the Bladder being briefly deſcribed, one thing remains, namely, the way of taking a Stone out of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> which we ſhall briefly deſcribe. It happens ſometimes, that it is void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Bladder; but when it is gotten into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> it ſticks there, and ſtops the paſſage of the Urine. In this caſe, all means muſt be tried and applied, which are proper to bring away a Stone, without Inciſion. Among theſe, firſt of all occur Diureticks, Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients, Fomentations, and Baths of a relaxing quality, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Stones of no ſmall bigneſs have been brought from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> The ſecond way is, Extenſion of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> by Wind, tying that part of the Yard, which is next the <hi>Pubes,</hi> in the ſame manner as it was frequently uſed by the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; for when the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, the paſſage is more free for the Stone. The third way is by ſucking, when by drawing the breath with great violence, the Stone is drawn with it. The fourth way is to break the Stone by the help of a <hi>Forceps</hi> and Probe, which is often uſed with ſucceſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much to be commended. But if all theſe ways be fruitleſs, we muſt proceed to Inciſion. Among Authors there is a great Conteſt about the place, wherein Inciſion ſhould be made. Some chuſe the Side, for fear, if the lower part ſhould be cut, there ſhould be a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> Others are for the lower part, leſt the Nervous Bodies ſhould be hurt. We have uſed both theſe ways, and found the cure eaſie, nor could we perceive any detriment accrue to the Patient, when we made Inciſion in the Nervous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral part. After inciſion is made, the Stone may be extracted with a fine little Hook. When theſe things are done, the Wounds after Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Stone whether of the Bladder or of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi>) muſt be cured. But ſince we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the beginning of this Work treated ſufficiently of Wounds of all ſorts, we ſhall here ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="646" facs="tcp:52816:337"/>and practicable way. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Authors indeed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms deſcribe a method; but ſo ambiguouſly, that he, who upon their credit ſhould undertake the reparation of any of theſe loſt parts, would loſe his own; and perhaps the Patient his life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without troubling you with what others ſay on this ſubject, I ſhall in ſhort give you what <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacotius</hi> ſays more at large there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>As that Man's Endeavours are to be admired, unto whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems hard or difficult, which upon Grounds of Reaſon, and by Induſtry is attainable: So he is to be pitied, who in attempting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betrays his Sloth, and not only is of the Opinion, that all things, eſpecially in Phyſick, are ſo fully found out already by the Antients, that there can be no room for further Invention; but (which is more hateful,) does by Calumny and Detraction diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as much as in him lies, all laudable attempts. But not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding ill-natured Perſons, ſome Men of Ingenuity and Reſolution, have ventured upon this difficult Operation; taking the hint from Horticulture, that, as Grafts or Buds are ingrafted or inoculated into Stocks, ſo in Animals one part might be ingrafted upon another, to ſupply a defect, where any ſhould happen. And thô this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal-ingrafting agree in many things with the Vegetable; yet they differ in ſeveral, and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal muſt be aided by the Artift's Induſtry. As in Vegetable-Graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Inoculation the Stock muſt be cloven, or the Bark perforated, ſo muſt the part in an Animal be wounded, upon which the tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive part is to be grafted. And the part, out of which reſtitution of what is deficient muſt be made, may be likened to a Tree or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from whence the Graft is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But in a traductive part of an Animal there muſt be more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Conformation according to the part which it ſupplies. Now that we may the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend our Buſineſs, we will conſider what matter is proper to ſupply parts deficient; from what place this matter ſhould be taken; the quantity of it; and the manner of agglutinating one part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The matter, out of which the foreſaid defects muſt be ſupplied, is the Skin, (which palpably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the miſtake of ſuch as thought, a Noſe muſt be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of ſolid Fleſh.) If you ask, Why the Skin? I anſwer, All Phyſicians hold, when we would ſupply a loſt part, that we muſt put in the room of it, ſomthing like in ſubſtance to it; or, if we cannot do that, ſomthing as near it as may be; as when we breed a <hi>Callus</hi> for a broken Bone, which ſupplies the room of a true Bone. Wherefore ſince the Lips, Noſe and Ears do much reſemble the ſubſtance of the Skin; and ſince, when part of them is cut off, it is impoſſible they ſhould of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhoot or bud out again, ſo as to remove the deformity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Authors of this Art, took the Skin of another part, and accommodated it to their uſe. This they thought, in imitation of graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Trees, was poſſible to be
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:52816:337"/>done: And they thought no part could with leſs inconvenience to Life be ſeparated from one place, and tranſlated to another, than the Skin. But ſince there be four ſorts of Skin, it will be requiſite to know, which of thoſe ſorts are for the purpoſe in hand. One ſort of Skin is bare of Hair, of exquiſite ſenſe, difficultly ſeparated from the Bodies underneath it, and will not fold as the reſt will, ſuch is the Skin of the Palms of the Hand, and of the Soles of the Feet. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort has a Muſcle, and that but a thin one, immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it, ſuch is the Skin of the Forehead. A third, by reaſon of the various and manifold Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of carnous Fibres, you may either call it a Cutaneous Muſcle, or a Muſculous Skin, no matter which, ſuch are the Lips and Cheeks. The laſt ſort is the common cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hairy, other-where without Hair, every where void of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may without difficulty be ſeparated from the ſubject parts. Of theſe four ſorts the laſt is only proper for our uſe. For the firſt cannot well be removed, without hazard of Life; nor (were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) could it be ſhaped into the faſhion of the loſt Member. In like manner the two middlemoſt ſorts are rejected, as alien, for they are to be met with but in few parts, nor can they commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be joyned to the defective part. But the laſt ſort may, and therefore is the fitteſt for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>The place from whence the Skin is taken, muſt be covered with a Skin like the loſt part, and big enough to ſupply the defect. And ſince it muſt have time to unite with the defective part, the Skin muſt be taken from ſuch a part as may be brought to the other, and, with as little incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the Patient as may be, may continue there. The only part to ſupply the Noſe and Lips, is the Arm above the Elbow; and to ſupply the Ears, the Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears. For neither disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures a Man, ſince the Arm is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Clothes, and the new Ear does indifferently well cover the place behind it, whence it was taken.</p>
                     <p>What quantity of ingrafted Skin one ſhould take, is hard to define. For it is obſerved, that the Skin after the ſecond cutting from the Arm, ſomtimes ſhrinks an eighth, a ſixth, or a fourth part both in length and breadth, by reaſon the Nutriment is not ſo plentifully brought to it, as when it was cloſe united to the Arm, or becauſe the Nutriment does not aſſimilate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But thô it be thus difficult to be exact in our quantity; yet we ſhould take the beſt meaſure we can, proportionable to the part we are to ſupply, and rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to exceſs than defect.</p>
                     <p>The way to unite the parts, is by ſtitching, and by that ſort which is called by ſome <hi>interſciſſa,</hi> and by us <hi>ſutura non continuata,</hi> which we treated of in our diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wounds.</p>
                     <p>There remains one difficulty to be reſolved, which is, Whether the ingrafted Skin ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from ones own Body, or from another Perſon's. There are good Reaſons, why it may be taken
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:52816:338"/>from another Perſon's. Plants thô of different Natures may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted one into another; what then ſhould hinder a piece of one Man's Body from being ingrafted into another's, ſeeing both are of the ſame kind, and nothing near ſo different as one kind of Tree is from another? But this ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a part from another's Body, having never been practiſed, nor likely to be practicable, we will conclude, that it is beſt to ſupply the defect from ones own Body. For a long time is required to unite the ſupplemental par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>o the defective, and all this while the two Bodies muſt be faſt bound one to the other. But I know not any contrivance poſſible, to keep two Perſon's Bodies ſo bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that they would rend one from the other, long before Coalition were made, and ſo our Intentions would be quite fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being premiſed to general, we will now proceed more practically to the Subject here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>An Enumeration of what things are neceſſary for the delineation of the traductive Skin, and the proviſion of all Implements.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEfore we talk of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this Work, we muſt firſt of all enumerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, what things are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the performance of the Work, that Chirurgeons may be fully informed, with what Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they muſt be furniſhed, before they undertake the deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the traductive Skin. For theſe things conſidered, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, they will perform their work with credit, and avoiding all confuſion, they will prevent all occaſion of miſtake, which might otherwiſe ariſe. Some of theſe things reſpect the Artiſt; others the Patient's Wound. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Artiſt, they are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and his fellow-helpers. For one Artiſt alone is not ſufficient to perform this operation; becauſe many things muſt be done at one and the ſame time, which require the aſſiſtance of ſeveral Perſons. The Chirurgeon therefore muſt have at leaſt two Servants; who muſt be, not only nimble in their Body and Hands; but of a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Eye to obſerve their Maſter's Commands, and to perform them. Theſe muſt of neceſſity be either well skilled in this ſort of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery; or they muſt be very prudent and diligent. For the Chirurgeon does not only ſtand in need of their help in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Medicines; but in making Diſſection, in deligation of the delineated graft, and then in inſerting of the ſame into the curt parts, which one work is more difficult than all the reſt, that are neceſſary to this ſort of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Let the Artiſt therefore, if he cannot get ſuch as are Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Experienced, at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch as are apprehenſive in their Mind, quick in their Senſes, and nimble of Body: And if they be raw in the buſineſs, before the operation let him inform them now and then, of all things that are to be done in the operation. For ſo he would have them more ready in his Service, more at his Beck, and exceeding Obedient. It is of moment beſides, to chuſe an opportune place, wherein to perform the operation, and to take care of a Bed for the Patient to lye on, with all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. For it is of no ſlight concernment, what ſort of Light there is, what its Poſition is, and what Pillows there are. Firſt, therefore the Chamber, wherein the Bed is ſet, muſt be very light, becauſe the Work requires a clear light: But the delineation of the
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:52816:340"/>traductive Skin, does eſpecially require it; for thô other things might be done by Candle-light; yet the delineation of the tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Skin muſt be done by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and all People but the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators muſt be put out of the room. The Patient moſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Bed, with his Face againſt a large Caſement, and the Bed muſt ſtand from the Wall on all hands, that the Operators may go round any way, as there ſhall be occaſion. There muſt be three Pillows in readineſs, whoſe uſe we ſhall ſhew afterwards: They muſt be ſtuft with Flocks, and not with Feathers; becauſe Feathers are apt to grow too hot, and by reaſon of their ſoftneſs, to give way. The Bed is better than any Chair or Seat.</p>
                     <p>And having reckoned up all things in reſpect of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geem, we will now proceed to what things are neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Patient; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of the propaginous Skin. Some things are to be performed, before the work is undertaken; others in the doing of it, and others after it is finiſhed. Among the preceding requiſites, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is; to contrive by all means how to ſtop the Blood when we cut the Skin: Becauſe in cutting the Skin, thô we wound no part elſe; Yet even this Wound may be feared, if an Inflammation, or an <hi>

For Anatomy ſhews us, that ſeveral Veſſels of all ſorts run along the Arm, and lye under the Skin, which if we have not a great care, may be wounded. Beſkles, there is danger in the largeneſs of the Wound, which the ſupplemental part muſt be of. For thô you make the wound at one cut, yet as ſoon as the <hi>Forceps</hi> is let go, a large <hi>Hiatus</hi> appears, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the propaginous Skin lies bare.

                     <p>As for things requiſite in the performing the operation, they are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Forceps,</hi> and Knives. The Chirurgeon muſt take care that they be ſharp, and whether they be convenient this way or another, he muſt lay them in a diſh for the purpoſe all in order; leſt there might be any confuſion in the operation, the blame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be laid on the Operator, and not on his Servants.</p>
                     <p>When the work is done, theſe things muſt be in readineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Linen to put into the Wound; Stupes to defend it and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts, ſtore of Medicines to take up in the Stupes; a broad Linen cloth to lay over the Stupes and the Wound; and a Roller to roll over the Stupes, and to bind the Wound. I ſhall now briefly ſhew you the uſe of theſe things. Firſt, there muſt be a piece of Linen cloth, to put between the raiſed Skin and the parts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, to keep them aſunder, leſt they ſhould grow together again. And there is one benefit more in the Linen cloth; that one may lay Medicines upon it to ſtop and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Blood. It ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of the ſame dimenſions with the Wound. You ſhould have pieces of ſeveral dimenſions in readineſs, that you may take one which ſuits beſt. You muſt alſo have flaxen Stupes, to guard the Wound; ſome broad and long; others narrow and ſhort, all of an orbicular ſhape, with their ſides a little compreſſed. Of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there muſt be four at leaſt, about three Inches broad, and ſix or ſeven long. They muſt not be over thick, for then they are cumberſome, as they ſwell with the liquid Medicine, and the Blood which they ſoak up, and when they once grow up, they inflame the Parts. The leſs muſt be two
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:52816:341"/>Inches broad and three long. It is convenient to lay all theſe on, and to guard the Wound well. But it may not be improper to make more than we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: For it is better to have too many than too few. Then it is proper to have a Linen-Cloth to go round all and ſtay the Wound. It muſt go round the Arm and the Wound, and it muſt be larger than the Wound: All theſe muſt be wet in Whites of Eggs, which muſt be well beaten, adding Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, a little Dragon's-blood, and <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> mixing and beating them well together. Then you muſt have a Roller ready, thin, and all of an evenneſs, about three Inches broad and four Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long. Either to bind the Wound too tight, or too ſlack, is inconvenient: Wherefore we muſt ſo order the matter, that what it wants in tightneſs, may be ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad by often rolling, and that there may be nothing, but the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler takes hold of it, let the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler be neither broader nor narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than we have mentioned; if it be broader, we cannot ſtraiten the Parts with it; if narrower, it will twine and twiſt like a Cord, and ſo hurt the Parts. It muſt not be rolled dry, but wet in <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> for when it is wet, it will be more pliable, and will be inſtead of a Medicine, to ſtop blood. We have been the more copious and particular in theſe things; becauſe it is an odious thing to have ought to ſeek, when we go about ſuch an Operation as this.</p>

                        <p>In what manner the cutaneous Graft muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have already diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all things that ſhould be in readineſs for the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; now we will proceed to the Operation it ſelf. The deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Skin, is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of all the reſt. Therefore here we muſt be exact, and do all things by <hi>Polycletus</hi> his Rule. However it is hard to define the quantity of the Skin exactly, ſince it depends on conjecture. But diligence and prudent circumſpection, will go far towards aſcertaining it's dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And after mature conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, let the Artiſt go couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly about his Work. Firſt, let him place the Patient on his Bed, and let him remove all Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either to the Patient, or to himſelf. Next, let him appoint thoſe that are to help him, their Stations and Places, every one in their order. Let the Patient lye on his Back upon the outer edge of the Bed. He may change this place, either for the convenience of the Chamber, or of cutting the Arm, if ſo be the light fall well. Thus he muſt be placed ready for the Chirurgeon and his Aſſiſtents, when they are about to begin the Operation. The Arm, whence the Skin is to be taken, muſt be made bare. The Aſſiſtents muſt be in their places. One muſt ſit on the upper end of the Bed behind the Patient's Head, at the Artiſt's right Hand. He muſt with his right Hand ſupport the Patient's Arm, and with his left, when there is occaſion, hold the light, or do any thing elſe, as occaſion requires. Another Perſon's Office is to lift up the Skin, to faſten the <hi>Forceps,</hi> to help the Chirurgeon, to hold up the <hi>Forceps,</hi> while the Artiſt cuts, and when the Work is performed, to take it away. And he muſt be at the Chirurgeon's left Hand, or on the contrary ſide, if the oppoſite Arm muſt be cut. For thus each of them by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their Places, will be enabled more readily to do their Duties, and obſerve the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's beck; for ſeveral things, while the Operation is performing, muſt be intimated by a Nod, and not by Words. Becauſe for the Patient's ſake, Words muſt be forborn. In the <hi>Interim,</hi> the Chirurgeon having his Hands free from all Entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt come near his Patient, always ſtanding; that on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he may turn which way he liſt, and buckle himſelf to his Work. And firſt of all, let him gently handle the Skin on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> whence he
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:52816:342"/>means to borrow his Graft, let him lift it up and let it fall again, and in the ſame manner raiſe it, and let it go again, that by this gentle Contrectation, it may be prepared for Separation with more caſe, when we ſhould cut it, and lift it quite up with the <hi>Forceps.</hi> But ever uſe moderation, leſt too rough handling before Section, ſhould make the Humors flow with greater impetuoſity after it ſhall be performed: For great Veins and Arteries lye near this place. And ſince the main buſineſs is the Symmetry of the Graft, you would do well, (eſpecially where the Operator is a Novice in the Practice of Addition,) to mark the Skin with Ink, and when he has taken up as much Skin as the caſe requires, he ſhall give it to his Aſſiſtent on his left Hand to hold, then he ſhall take the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> in both his Hands, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Aſſiſtent's Hands he ſhall fix it on the traductive Skin. Yet in the mean time, if he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the preſcribed quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he muſt raiſe it and take it up again, and having looked well on both ſides, whether all things are right, he muſt ſtraiten his <hi>Forceps,</hi> and faſten it there with an Iron Ring. He ſhall give this again to the Aſſiſtent on his left Hand, and then he may proceed to Section. Preſently therefore let him take the Knife in his right Hand, and thruſt the point in gently through the Skin, about the middle of the ſlit in the <hi>Forceps,</hi> and ſo cut on each ſide to the very corner of the ſlit, if need require. When Section is thus made, which is the firſt ſtep in the Art, and as it were, the Rudiment of the whole Work, and when the Knife is laid down, or given to one of the Aſſiſtents, he muſt with the end of the Probe thruſt a piece of Linen Cloth through the gaping skin. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent on his left hand muſt get this ready. He may take meaſure by the ſlit of the <hi>forceps,</hi> and out of the great variety lying by him, may chuſe the fitteſt. When it is put through, if it be wrinkled any where, it muſt be made ſmooth, and diſtended along the whole ſpace, ſo as that the ends may hang at equal diſtances from the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps.</hi> Then the Artiſt may looſen his <hi>forceps,</hi> by taking off the ring which held the two handles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and give it to the Aſſiſtent on his left Hand to hold up gently, and preſently let him put his right Hand under the <hi>Humerus,</hi> in the inſide, and let him raiſe the Arm a little, that the place may lye bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the cure, which muſt be uſed to it by and by. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, between the Plates of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi> when it is opened, let him lay his Hand on the Wound, and with his Fingers expanded let him hold down the Cloth on both ſides, which is ſtill in the ſlits of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps.</hi> For ſo he hinders the Cloth from being pulled out with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> when the Aſſiſtent takes it away, which he muſt do aſſoon as the Artiſt lays his left Hand on the Wound. When theſe things are done, the Artiſt muſt compoſe his Graft and ſix it in an even Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. I call the Graft, all that Skin which is ſeparated from the Muſcles underneath, and which is circumſcribed by it's internal and external <hi>Superficies,</hi> and on each
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:52816:342"/>Hand by the ſides of the Section, This, for cauſes which we ſhall mention afterward, the Lips turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwards, does ſomtimes ſwell ſtrangely. It will therefore be convenient either with a Probe, or with the inſide of the Hand to ſmooth down all unevenneſſes, and lay them right, that the Graſt may be equally extended, according to all its parts, and preſently to go about its proper Cure. For here any delay is dangerous: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artiſt muſt put the ſhorter ſtupes, which he has in readineſs, to the Wound innermoſt, and others outwardly, and over theſe he muſt lay the large ones, one at each ſide, and one at each end. And when he has in this manner guarded the whole Wound, then he muſt lay a Linen Cloath double for a common guard to all, and that the Wound may be the better bound. But this muſt be done by Rollers. Therefore taking the Roller in his Right Hand, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of it, let him apply it to the upper part of the Graſt, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Left Thumb on the end of it, and roll downward toward the inſide of the Arm. When this is done, let him ſtraiten the Arm a little, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oll again, rolling gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually downwards, till the whole Graft, and the broad Linen Cloath, which is brought over it, be by rolling from one end to the other all covered. And the Artiſt muſt take care, that in binding, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraiten nor ſlacken the part too much. If it be over ſlack, the Blood will run to it, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments off it. If it be over-tight, it will weaken the part, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ate heat of the Skin: Whereupon the Graft dies, becauſe all manner of paſſage for the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtopt. And moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtrait binding cauſes pain, this will cauſe an afflux of Humors, and (which is the utter ruine of the Graft,) will occaſion Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Eryſipelas</hi>'s, and other Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Wherefore moderation muſt be uſed. Let him turn in the end of the laſt Roller about an Inch, then tie the end over with Thread; ſo there will be no fear of its undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and thus is the adminiſtration of the delineated Graft performed. But ſtill there is a care incumbent on the Artiſt, to keep both the Arm and the Patient himſelf quiet and undiſturbed. And for this, a middle poſture is moſt proper; ſo the Arm muſt be bent. This I would have obſerved, that as the <hi>Humerus</hi> hangs down a little, ſo the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> may be gently raiſed, and in the ſame moderation the Hand muſt be above the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna.</hi> For this reaſon, as we ſaid, care muſt be had of Pillows, Bolſters, and ſuch Furniture. Therefore while the Artiſt lays the Pillows, both his Aſſiſtents muſt ſtay the Patient's Arm. He that is uppermoſt, and ſits at the Artiſts Right Hand, muſt put his Left Hand under the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Armpit, and lay his Right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Elbow; the other muſt with his Right Hand ſtay the Patients <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and with his Leſt Arm go round his Body. By thus doing, they will on both ſides keep the Arm ſteady and quiet, which is the principal thing we deſire, becauſe of the violent terdency of the Blood to any diſturbed part. All things being in this poſture, the Artiſt muſt bend the Arm, the
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:52816:343"/>Aſſiſtents helping, into a ſafe and opportune poſture, and, according is the ſeaſon is either hot or cold, cover it with Linen or Woollen. It will alſo be requiſite for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient not to ſtir in the leaſt, leſt the quiet of the Arm be diſturbed, and put the Humors in motion, which of themſelves are too apt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore a profound reſt both of the Arm and the whole Body is abſolutely neceſſary. But this is not all, we muſt likewiſe give check to the violent motion of the Humours. Therefore we muſt endevour to defend the part by pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on refrigerants and repellents all over the Region of the Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Humerus,</hi> eſpecially toward the Armpits for an hour or two. Of which ſort of Medicines <hi>Poſca</hi> is beſt, provided it be in quantity ſufficient: For I have found by good ſucceſs that it ſtops the moſt impetuous Fluxes of Blood.</p>

Within a day or two, or after all fear of a Haemorrhage is over, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whites of Eggs may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and that very gently, leſt any little branch of a Vein might upon a ſlight touch bleed afreſh. Wherefore it were good to have ſome ſinged cotton to apply to the Wound. If the Cloaths be hard and dry, and do ſtick faſt, they muſt be ſoftned by moiſtning. <hi>Poſea</hi> is good for this uſe, and then Oyl of unripe Roſes. Theſe may ſomtimes be miſt and applied either cold or a little warm, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always regard to the Seaſon, and other Medical Circumſtances. For Medicines when they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately warm do better inſinuate themſelves, and by the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their quality perform what we deſire. But the Artiſt muſt have a care they be not too hot, leſt the Blood being ſtimulated thereby, burſt out again. Let therefore the Aſſiſtents ſtand on each Hand, one of which muſt hold a Baſon to receive what comes from the Wound, and the other muſt have liquor, fit to moiſten the Cloaths. In the mean while the Roller muſt be taken off, with all the gentleneſs imaginable, ſo as not to diſturb the Arm or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Wherefore it were beſt to clip it with Sciſſars, not all the Rounds at once, but one by one, and rather on the outſide than the inſide of the Arm. For in ſo doing we ſhall neither diſturb thoſe parts by its motion, nor ſhall we come near thoſe great Veſſels of the Arm, which it is the beſt not to touch at all. When the Rounds of the Rollers are ſtiff with Blood, it is the Aſſiſtents part to irrigate them by dropping liquor from on high. Then he may take them off with a Probe, or, when joyned, he may gently ſever them with his Fingers, and throw them into the Baſon, and when the Wound is laid bare, he may cover it with a white Linnen Cloth made warm, while the Artiſt is making ready for the reſt of his Work; who muſt take that Cloth off, and apply another to the Wound, ſpread with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puratives. Where note, that the firſt Cloth muſt not be taken off, till the other is ready to clap on, which muſt be done as near the ſame inſtant as may be: Which is a rule ever to be obſerved. Then the Artiſt muſt take up the end of the Linen. Cloth, which is run under, in the outſide of the Arm, and ſew another of the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, running the Needle along, and no where ſewing double, leſt
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:52816:344"/>by its bulk it might exaſperate the Wound. Then with his Right Hand taking hold of the inner end let him raiſe it, and draw it through till all the old is come through, and the new is drawn into the Wound. Then one of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtents muſt clip off the Old, and throw it into the baſon with the reſt. But if the Lips turn inwards, then let the Artiſt with his Probe ſpread it again gently, and drop in a little Turpentine either alone, or mixt with Oyl of Roſes, then let him apply Lint dipt in Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and upon that Linen Cloths, wet in Repellents, warm; then in the ſame moderation that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly preſcribed, let him bind all up again, and place the Arm in a middle poſture. Theſe Repellents differ nothing or but very little from the other. If they do, it is beſt to apply gentle ones to the Graft, and ſtronger to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Armpits.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Cure of ſome Symptoms, which ſomtimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the delineated Skin.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THree ſorts of Symptoms do ſomtimes befal the delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Skin. A Mortification of ſome of the edge of the cutaneous Graft, an Inflammation of it, and of the parts adjacent, and profuſion of Blood. There are ſeveral cauſes of Mortification in this caſe, a Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Veneral habit of Body; a lax and thin Skin, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat is weak; too violent pinching with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> and too ſtrait binding. Unleſs therefore the Patient be of a good habit of Body, eſpecial care muſt be had, in taking up the Skin with the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi> to uſe ſuch moderation as but juſt to keep it up, and not let it ſlip and hinder the operation. It is a good way to take enough of the Skin, that if a little Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould happen, there may be ſtill enough to ſerve the turn. Great care alſo, as we have ſaid before, muſt be had in binding, that it be neither too ſtrait nor over ſlack. But when you have a ſuſpition of this miſchief, (as you very well may in the forementioned Bodies,) the Wound muſt be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not let alone till the third or fourth day, you muſt look very narrowly to the edges, that time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care may prevent the worſt. You may know it is beginning, when upon trial by a Probe, ſenſe is either ſmall or quite loſt, and if the part look very pale or livid. It muſt therefore be reſiſted by things that dry ſtrongly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Putrefaction. Such is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> whereof there are ſeveral ſorts; but this is the beſt; ℞. <hi>Alumin. virid. aeris, mellis, aceti acerrimi à. p. ae. M.</hi> Praecipitate is good either alone or in Oynment of Roſes, and other Oyntments. Somtimes <hi>pulvis aloes</hi> ſtrowed on the Skin has quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Malady. It is beſt to uſe a decoction of Lupiues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Aloes has been boiled. This is alſo a very ſafe Oyntment; ℞. <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinth. letae ex ſucco abſinth.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>farin. bord. cretae</hi> ℥ j. <hi>pollinis aloes puriſſim.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>mell, albi ſinceriſſim. q. ſ. agitetur mel, excipianturque ſingula, &amp; ex arte paretur exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens medicamentum.</hi> You may uſe it in Oyntments and apply them to the parts that are tending to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction. Great care muſt be had of the Patient's Diet, eſpecially were the Body is Cacochymick or Venercal. All things therefore muſt be drying and conſumers of excrementitious moiſture.</p>
                     <p>The next Symptom, which ſomtimes ends in the former, is an Inflammation. For becauſe the Blood runs plentifully to that part, all there about is ſwollen, red, and
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:52816:345"/>painful, and if not prevented, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens certain ruine to theſe parts, eſpecially to the Graft. This is moſt apt to ariſe in the Spring time, and when People have fared plentifully before; wherefore it is altogether proper to prepare Folks Bodies before the operation. When an Inflammation doth ariſe, the beſt way is to bleed in the contrary Arm. The Patient's ſtrength muſt define the quantity. Diet muſt be preſcribed. The Patient muſt abſtain from all hot things; and things of a penetrating ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Coolers and Aſtringents are beſt. No Drink at all muſt be uſed; Spoon-Meat is ſufficient. Rubbing the lower parts with courſe Cloaths, Cupping either without, or with very ſmall Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, when too little Blood has been taken away. Lotions of the extream parts are good, a little warm, with cooling Herbs boiled therein. Bleeding the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoides with Leeches is proper.</p>
                     <p>The next Symptom is, profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood, which may be ſtopt by letting Blood in the oppoſite Arm, if the Patient's ſtrength will bear it; by Cupping, Scarifying Ligatures and Frictions. It is good to roll ſeveral Rollers pretty hard, not dry, but wet in <hi>Poſca,</hi> hereby I have known Bleeding ſeveral times ſtopt. In this caſe it is beſt not to open the Wound till the fourth day. Next of all, the whole Region of the Shoulder muſt be fomented with <hi>Poſca,</hi> and Cloths wet therein, frequently renewed, before they grow warm. When the Wound is opened, it is good to have things in readineſs that ſtop Bleeding, if it ſhould happen, ſuch as ſinged Cotton applied either to the Wound or cloſe by it. <hi>Caſtane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Why the taking up of the Graft is deferred, and not done at one Section, what time is proper for the Adminiſtration, and what Proviſion muſt be made for it?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE reaſon why all is not done at one Section, but part of the Operation deferred, is, becauſe the cutaneous Graft, if it were cut quite off at the ſame time that it is delineated, would ſhrivil up all on a heap, which might occaſion a Mortification, for that Medicaments could not then ſo well be applied, as when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated: Beſides, the great Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles would be laid quite bare, which would produce the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, if they were expoſed to the open Air. Wherefore it ſeems moſt proper to perform the Operation gradually.</p>
                     <p>As to the time, when the cuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Graft ſhould be taken up, it cannot be deſined by days or hours; it's requiſite corpulence and the intermiſſion of Symptoms will beſt determine that. For upon affluence of Blood, and it's being by heat compacted into carnous Fibres, the Skin grows thicker, ſo that when it is cut off it does not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ivle up together; which (as I ſaid before,) was the reaſon why the Skin was not both delineated and cut off at one and the ſame time. We muſt therefore tarry till the Skin grow thick and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact enough, which (if we may ſet any certainty to things uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,) it uſually is within Fourteen days. In which time the ſubject Parts have the benefit to be clothed with a new Skin, whereby they are fenced from the Injuries of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air. And another main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for deferring it, is, the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the violent Symptoms, which muſt needs fall out in that time, and which would otherwiſe ſpoil the whole buſineſs. A brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing time therefore is requiſite for a ſecond Operation, and <hi>Sat c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And becauſe it is good for an Artiſt to have his Tools about him, we will conſider what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion there muſt be made for the Operation.

But as to the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Section, it is twofold; either it is right from the inner angle of the Graft, to the outer <hi>Superficies;</hi> or it is ſloping from the inner Angle of the Graft, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Shoulder, ſomtimes ſo, as to take in an Inch and an half more of Skin. For when we find that the delineation of the Graft falls ſhort, and that it ſhrinks, then is the time to eak what it wants by an oblique or ſlant Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Becauſe Nature endeavours Unition, as much as ſhe can, at both ends of the Graft, which ſhorten it much. And when the Skin is looſe and thin, this Section is proper, as we may gather by its ſhrinking in breadth. But when there is no ground for Fear, then a right Section, without any ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is beſt.</p>
                     <p>The Patient muſt be ſet on his Bed, in the ſame place and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:52816:346"/>as we adviſed for the deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Skin, againſt the Light, at a diſtance from the Wall, and on the ſide of the Bed, for the more convenience of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The aſſiſtents muſt obſerve their ſtations; one at the Artiſts right hand, the other at his left. the one muſt hold the Patients Arm leaning on Pillows, with the Hand upright, from the Elbow: The other muſt handle the <hi>Hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> according as the Artiſt ſhall direct, and as the Graft muſt be cut right or ſloping. If the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt make a right Section, he muſt order the Aſſiſtent at his right hand to compreſs the Skin next the Graft. For often the Skin gives way, and hinders the right Section. Now the Aſſiſtent will hold the Skin right, if he put one hand under the Armpit, and the other as near as he can to the Cutaneous Graft. Then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt muſt with a Probe lift up the Cutaneous Graft, putting his left Forefinger underneath, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his left Thumb over againſt it, let him hold the Graft gently up. Then let him take the knife in his right hand, and cut even, and at a right Angle upwards. When the Graft is taken up, let him turn it back toward the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and guard it well with Lint, where it is wounded. For ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when a Vein is cut, it will bleed much. And this is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of right Section. But in the oblique or ſloping Section, the Aſſiſtent lays no hand on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Arm, only the Artiſt puts his knife between the Graft and the Muſcle, underneath, and cuts ſlanting upwards. Aſſoon as he has conſidered how much he will add to the Graft, let him take it up between his right Thumb and Fore-finger, and give it to the Aſſiſtent at his right hand to hold. He muſt then put his Probe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Graft, putting gently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it his left fore-finger, laying his Thumb over againſt it, and then he muſt raiſe the Skin gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as the knife may have room to go in. Which he muſt take in his right hand, and with ſome ſtrength cut ſlanting, as far as he ſhall think good. When the Graft is taken up, he muſt turn it back to the Elbow, and where it was cut off, he muſt cover it with Lint, and fence it well. But he may immediately commit this to be done by his aſſiſtent. And the Artiſt himſelf may look to the other Part, may lay on Lint, and take care by all means to ſtop the bleeding. Then my advice is, to cover the whole Bed with divers Liniments, and then to lay on the broad linen Cloth. He may give the Graft to the Aſſiſtent on his left hand, who may conveniently hold it in his right, and, with warm linen Cloaths, keep it conſtantly from the injuries of the Air. In the mean time, the Artiſt muſt be covering the whole Bed, by rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with one Roller, whoſe end muſt be faſtned with a needle and thread on the outſide of the Arm. When this is done, let him lay ſome Ointment over the Roller, as far as the cutaneous Graft will reach, and then let him lay back the Graft upon it. Great care muſt be taken to ſpread it well both in length and breadth. When the Graft is turned back, laid
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:52816:347"/>ſmooth, and placed as it ought, the Artiſt muſt order an Aſſiſtent to lay his middle and fore Finger on the top of it, and bid him take care that it ſhrink not. Then let him take another Roller, and apply it where the Graft grows to the Stock, and there begin to roll, till he has covered the whole Graft, and bound it to the Arm. Here is the difficulty of the buſineſs: For if the Graft be bound too tight, it dies; if too ſlack, it ſhrinks. Therefore great care muſt be taken herein. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is difficult to hit right at firſt, the Artiſt, that he may be ſure, muſt, whenever he opens the the Part, diligently take notice of the whole Subſtance of the Skin, whether it be as it ought, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it dies, or ſhrinks. This the Eye will ſhew; the other is known by paleneſs and ſenſeleſneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Error herein is very hard to amend, therefore I would by all means advice the Artiſt to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it. When all is done, he muſt place the Arm in a middle poſture, as before. And ſo the Adminiſtration of this Operation is performed.</p>
                     <p>Here it will not be amiſs to mark out the parts of the Graft, and aſſign to them, and to ſome other things, names, that when we have occaſion to mention them, we may not uſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions. Horticulture directs us beſt in giving Names. For from it the beſt hints of any ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were taken, and by it we have been hitherto directed. All therefore that is the ſubject of our operation, we call the <hi>Graft,</hi> the <hi>Cutaneous Graft,</hi> the <hi>Propagmous Skin,</hi> or the <hi>Brachial Skin.</hi> Its length and breadth are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but ſo is not its depth. The length exceeds the breadth uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Third. The length we may divide into three parts, the upper, middle and lower, and we may give every one its name. By the upper part we mean that, which was laſt cut from the Arm, which we call <hi>the top of the Graft.</hi> We might more properly call it the <hi>inſititious end or top,</hi> becauſe it is ingrafted into the cut parts. The lower part, which grows to the Arm, we may call <hi>the root of the Graft;</hi> for from hence Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is carried into the reſt of the Graft, as from the Root into the Tree. What is between the Top and the Root, we may very well call <hi>the body of the Graft.</hi> As to the <hi>Superficies,</hi> we call it either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External,</hi> the <hi>Inſide</hi> or <hi>Outſide,</hi> or the later we may call <hi>the Cutanous Side.</hi> The edges of the Graft we call either <hi>Interror</hi> or <hi>Exterior,</hi> or <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> or <hi>External linear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,</hi> We may properly enough call them <hi>Lips;</hi> becauſe both in roundneſs and thickneſs, they much reſemble the Lips of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>This we thought fit to mention concerning Names, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion might be avoided, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities cleared, which might otherwiſe ariſe about Names.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Cure of the New and Old Wound, both in the Graft, and in the Bed, and alſo of rearing the Graft.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHen we took up the Graft, our care was firſt to ſtop bleeding. The next day it will be proper to open the Wound, and to look well about, what ſhould be avoided, and what ſhould be done further.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two Wounds in each part, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Bed, and in the Graft, altogether diverſe, each whereof requires its proper Cure. That which was made at the firſt delineation, both in the Bed and Graft, is old: The other is new, both at the top of the Graft, and at the upper end of the Bed. Any one may ſee, theſe require different Remedies. The Part newly wounded requires Suppuration. But the old Wound, after the abundance of Humors gathered by Affluxion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is ſpent, dies by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Part cauſed by wounding, inſtead of Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters were Driers, and theſe no ordinary ones, that all that is ſoft may turn into Skin or <hi>Callus.</hi> In the mean time care muſt be taken, that both the top of the Graft, and the upper edge of the Bed, be brought to perfect Suppuration, which is uſually done in nine days, or at moſt in eleven, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſeven. For here we do not allow ſo long a time for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Pus,</hi> as before, becauſe we have another deſign now; and there were ſeveral ſufficient reaſons then to protract the Suppuration of the Wound. As the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Symptoms, whoſe rage ought firſt to be appeaſed. And the thickning of the Skin, or at leaſt, the hindrance of its decreaſe. For no ſmall ſtrength accrews to it from the growth of carnous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, which put a ſtop to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Graft. Wherefore you may ſooner leave off Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters, and uſe Driers, when the Parts begin to have a <hi>Callus</hi> or Skin. It is a ſign, Wounds are ſufficiently ſuppurated, when the Artiſt ſees, what <hi>Celſus</hi> learnedly obſerves, <hi>An equal Redneſs all over, moderation in Drineſs and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and little or no pain.</hi> For then it is time to leave off Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters, and to endeavor all you can to cicatrize the Wound, which is done both in the Bed and Graft by the ſame Remedies. Only the Bed, as Experience has taught us, requires ſtronger Medicines; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wound in the Arm is
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:52816:348"/>moiſter and fouler, by reaſon it is upon the Muſcles, to which the adjacent Veſſels give a liberal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Vapors and Humors, and ſo hinder the drying of the Sore, in which it's Cure chiefly conſiſts: But where (a, in the cutaneous Graft,) there is but little moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, it grows callous ſooner; and therefore the Graft requires much gentler Medicaments, than the Bed. It is beſt therefore, when it is at the Artiſt's choice, (however his ſcope may be the ſame,) to protract the Cure of this a little, ſince each Part has now and then it's proper Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. But let us paſs the Cure of the Graft, and proceed to that of the Bed. There are ſeveral cicatrizing Medicaments; but this we have had Experience of, <hi>

Wherefore it is beſt to prepare the Body well before the Operation be undertaken. If any Purgatives be given afterwards, they muſt be very gentle. But a well-ordered diet is the main thing, being both eaſieſt and ſafeſt.</p>
                     <p>Now we will proceed to the Cure and rearing of the Graft. The chief of the Cure conſiſts in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a <hi>Callus</hi> by good Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The rearing of the Graft conſiſts in nouriſhing it by plenty of kindly Aliment. When the Cicatrice is bred, it is fit for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting. But we muſt firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate the new Wound in the Graft, and then cicatrize it. The Medicaments are the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So dry Linen Cloths, and thoſe medicated, or Lint, are good, prepared in this manner. Take fine thin Linen Cloths, wet them in the Liquor, which we ſhall now deſcribe, dry them in the ſhade, and ſo wet them and dry them three or four times. This is the Liquor: ℞ <hi>Gallar. immatur.

<pb n="670" facs="tcp:52816:349"/>order of time, we ſhall diſtinguiſh the time of the cutaneous Graft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Ages. For as the time of all Animals living is circumſcribed by certain Intervals, wherein their Bodies receive notable Changes; ſo the time of the Graft may very uſefully be diſtinguiſhed into it's Ages, wherein it undergoes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Alterations. The Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Graft is the time from it's taking up till the Wound is dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo long as there is no drineſs in the Carnous Fibres, but they are all ſoft, flaccid and moiſt. For whereas before it was nouriſhed at both the ends, now it receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment but at one, and ſo muſt needs languiſh and be ſubject to divers Symptoms, Ulcers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, and Corruption of part of it; all which are obviated, as we have taught formerly. The youth of the Graft is, when ſigns of Drineſs ſhew themſelves; for then the Skin neither receives the Excrements of other Parts, nor breeds any in itſelf. This is a great ſign of Strength: The Eggs grow callous firſt, and then the reſt; and the top before the root. The Manhood of the Grafting is, when the Cicatrice is come to the root, and all it's inner <hi>Superficies</hi> is turn'd callous. The old Age is, when the Graft is all over cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                     <p>Now it remains, that we treat of the ill Accidents that befal the Graft; And firſt of all we will treat of that which comes through the Artiſt's fault, <hi>viz.</hi> The decay of the Graft through the uneven laying and binding of it up. For when it is turned either to the right or left, and the Skin lies on rucks, Ulcers do ariſe and ſo the Graft is fretted. You may know it by the bandage being on rucks, or the Skin it ſelf, for there Ulcers are moſt apt to ariſe. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Graft is ſtarved, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of it's Aliment being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Wherefore great care muſt be had in binding, about the Poſition of the Graft, that it lie even; and then Ulcers are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. But if any one ſhould prove ſo ſupinely imprudent, as to commit ſuch a miſtake, he muſt help it thus. Suppoſe the Graft be turn'd to the left; this turning muſt be put even; it may be reduced by a Linen Cloth about an hand's breadth folded, till it be but an Inch in breadth; lay this on the Graft when you have laid it right, at the roof, then bind it up with Rollers, as before, thus with Bolſters you may reduce it; and when there ſhall be no further occaſion, you may leave them off. The Ulcers, if there be any, may be cured as thoſe in the Bed.</p>
                     <p>When the Graft fades, and grows more languid than it ought, this happens ſomtimes through too ſtrait binding, ſomtimes from a <hi>Callus,</hi> obſtructing the Paſſage of Aliment. When the fault is in the binding, the Artiſt may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily help it. But when the cauſe lies in ſome fault of the Graft it ſelf, or of ſome other Parts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well conſidered where it lies, we muſt endeavor to remove it. When it lies in other Parts, the remedy lies in carrying off Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities by purgings. When it lies in the Intemperature, ſuppoſe in the Frigidity of the Graft it ſelf; then it is beſt to uſe gentle Fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:52816:349"/>to the Part: For that brings Nutriment into it from the root, by opening it's Paſſages. You may rub till the Part grows red, and ſwells a little, which are ſigns you have done it good. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do more, you do thereby but diſcuſs and waſte it's Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You muſt rub from the root towards the Graft. You may excite the languiſhing heat by irrigating the outer Skin with hot Oyls made actually warm. The Artiſt may do it thus, he may take ſome Cotton dipt in the ſaid Oyls, and anoint the Graft over all the outſide, then with his Hand he may rub from the root to the top ſeveral times, then wipe it, and bind it up. A Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation alſo of generous Wine may be prepared, eſpecially in Winter Cold, and in Phlegmatick Perſons. No moiſt thing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no Oyl, may be uſed to the inſide of the Graft, becauſe it hinders <hi>Callus.</hi>

                        <p>The time of Ingrafting, that is, of what Age a cutaneous Graft muſt be choſen, to ingraft with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>VVE told you before, there were ſeveral Ages of the Graft, in one of which Inciſion muſt of neceſſity be made. No Man, I think, will grant, it may be made in all. For upon what account we deferred the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of the Graft after it's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation, upon the very ſame here we protract Inciſion. Becauſe the Graft has not ſtrength enough to undergo the violence of Inciſion, and to preſerve it ſelf likewiſe from ſudden withering away, for the Fleſh is not firm enough. And other Symptoms were to be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, Inflammation and Bleeding, whoſe violence were enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the Operation. Wherefore it could by no means be, that as ſoon as ever it was cut off, and in it's Infancy, it could be implanted into the curt Noſe. Nor is the time of it's youth proper, ſince the violence of the Symptoms is not quite aſſwaged, nor is it ſtrong enough to endure the violence of Inciſion, nor, were it implanted, would it well unite. For it not being yet dry enough, but moiſt and continually moiſtened with Excrements from the Brain, no wonder, if it ſhould putrefy, or at leaſt heal with much difficulty. But it is not worth while to tarry for it's old Age. For we require a Graft firm and robuſt, not flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and feeble. For what, I pray, ſhould we do with it? The Noſe is perfectly to be repaired, which we can never do with a ſoft, wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled, pale, juiceleſs, and diſeaſed Part, (for old Age is a diſeaſe to every thing,) nor can we imagine it. We muſt therefore take the Graft, and ingraft it into the curt Parts, when it is grown hard, and begins to decline, but is ſo ſtrong as to endure the violence of the Operation well enough.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of things neceſſary for Ingrafting.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AMong things requiſite for Ingrafting, ſome are for convenience, others for neceſſity; and theſe are neceſſary, either in the very operation, or after it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. We will begin with thoſe that are for convenience. And firſt of all, the Head muſt be ſhaven, made clean from Dandriff, and kept from Lice. The Beard muſt be ſhaven. All this ſhould be done the Evening before the intended operation. Things neceſſary for Ingrafting, are Knives, Sciſſars, Needles, Thread, Head-rollers, a Chair, Cloth, and Lint. The uſe of the Knives is, to excoriate the curt Noſe, and the cutaneous Graft. They muſt be very ſharp, and ſeveral of them; and thoſe of ſeveral ſhapes, ſtreight and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, according as the operation ſhall require. The Sciſſars muſt be ſharp; their uſe is, to clip off the remains of Fleſh or Skin, which cannot be cut off with a Knife. There muſt be a Roller, an Ell and an half long, and eight Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad. This muſt be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, it muſt go round the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and tye behind. Its uſe is, when the Graft and Noſe are ſtitcht, to ſtick the Needles in order, leſt they might otherwiſe be confounded and intangled. The Needles muſt be very ſharp and triquetrous, ſuch as Glovers uſe: They muſt be ſtrong, and there muſt be three, or more, above the number you have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, that, if any break, you may not want. The Thread muſt be midling and even; but it muſt never have been boiled. The Thread for each of the Needles ſhould be about five Ells long. The Chair may be an ordinary one, without Arms to it, upright in the back, to the loweſt <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of the Neck; but then it muſt be a little reclining, for the Head to lean upon: For it is better to perform this operation in a Chair, than on a Bed. There muſt be a Cloth to wrap about the Patients Neck and Breaſt, to receive the Blood, and to keep him clean. There muſt be Rags and Lint, to wipe the Blood off the excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Parts. Theſe things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the operation.</p>
                     <p>Things neceſſary when the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is performed, are either for the Cure, or for the Conſervation of the Parts, when they are ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The firſt is performed by Medicaments. There are two Parts, which we muſt take care of, the Bed, and the Suture of the Ingrafted parts. There needs no alteration be made in the Cure of the Bed; but the ſame things may be uſed as before. And whatever is good for a green Wound, and
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:52816:351"/>for a Suture, the ſame is good to cure the ingrafted parts. We muſt therefore repreſs an afflux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and an Inflammation. This may be done with the white of an Egg and Roſe-water in the ſame proportion as before. There muſt be two Pledgets of Low, about an Inch broad, and as long as the Noſe, to guard the Suture. The other muſt be as long, but broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to guard the adiacent parts from Inflammation. And becauſe the Suture penetrates to the inſide of the Noſe, there may be two Tents made, big enough for the Noſtrils, and long enough to help the Cure, but not ſo long as to cauſe Sneezing. Both the Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and the Tents muſt be dipt in the whites of Eggs, when there is occaſion to uſe them. Thus much for the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Now we proceed to the Rollers, and ſuch things as are for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Work, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But before we ſay any thing of the Rollers, we will ſhew the poſture of the Arm, which theſe Rollers are to keep it in. And it is thus; We muſt raiſe the <hi>Humerus</hi> as much as we may, and apply that part of the Arm, where the <hi>Muſculus triqueter</hi> ends, to the Face, or near the Noſe. Then the <hi>Cubitus</hi> muſt be bent in a little, it muſt alſo be brought upwards, and at the Wriſt it muſt lye juſt on the top of the Forehead. The Hand muſt be clapt on the Head, along the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tura Sagittalis,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Brachiale</hi> may be almoſt upon the <hi>Sutura coronaria,</hi> the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpium</hi> upon the crown of the Head, and the middle Finger may almoſt reach the angle of the <hi>Lambdoeides.</hi> And becauſe the Arm muſt be continued in this poſture till the parts are united, and that without motion, (for otherwiſe the coalition of the Parts would be hindred,) it muſt be ſo contrived, that, be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient never ſo willing, he cannot move his Arm. But beſides, the motion of the Head muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; for if the Head be not kept ſteady, the caſe will be the ſame. Now the Head may be kept ſteady by a Hood fixt to the Doublet behind, coming a little over the Forehead, down along the ſides of the Cheeks, with holes for the Ears, and fixt tight to the Doublet again before. The Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet muſt be well faſtned to the Breeches, becauſe there is the ſtay of all. There muſt be ſeveral Rollers, to bind the ſeveral parts of the Arm, of which that is the chief, which comprehends all the back part of the Arm; and from which, as branches from a Tree, all the other proceed. This may be called the Royal Roller. Its riſe is from the Shoulder-joynt and Armpit, and it goes from thence along the <hi>Humerus</hi> to the Elbow; from thence to the <hi>Cubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and ſo to the Wriſts and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's ends. Its office is, by the help of other Rollers faſtned to the edges, to keep the Arm faſt to the Head, and to give riſe to the other Rollers, of which there are four in number. The Firſt begins behind the <hi>Humerus,</hi> comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Armpit, and ſo goes along to the other Armpit: This may therefore be called the Axillary Roller. It muſt be three Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad. Its office is to guard
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:52816:351"/>the Shoulder-joynt. The Second is the Elbow-Roller; it muſt be as broad as the former. It comes from the edges of the Royal Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and both on the right and left faſtens the Arm to the Head going behind, and it is faſtned to the Hood about the Lambdoeidal lines. And it is of ſuch moment to keep the Arm faſt, that there is another Roller, which comes from the infide of the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> a little above the Elbow-roller, and ſo goes acroſs the Breaſt, and is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Doublet about the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondria.</hi> This may be called the Pectoral Roller. Laſt of all, there is a Roller which faſtens the Arm to the Head at the Wriſt: It may be called the Brace-Roller. And theſe are the things we would have in readineſs before Inciſion.</p>

                     <p>VVHen the Artiſt has a mind to perform Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let him chuſe the Forenoon for the time, becauſe then Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are concocted. Therefore the Patient would do well to eat but a light Supper before. A Tailor ſhould be at hand, to fit the Inſititious garment to the Patient. Let the Patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt put on his Breeches, then his Doublet and Hood, let him tye his Doublet to his Breeches with points; then let him button his Doublet. Then put on the Hood, put the Ears out at the holes, and fit it right to the Head. Then let the Artiſt raiſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Arm, (letting the Graft alone as it is,) and let him put it in the poſture, we mentioned before. The Aſſiſtents muſt keep it thus, while the Artiſt fits the Rollers. Let him firſt open the Royal Roller, bring it behind the Arm, obliquely along the Face, and faſten it to the Hood upon the ſides of the Lambdoeidal Suture. There muſt be two ſtrings, and three or four Fingers breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each. Theſe eyelet-holes muſt be overcaſt by a Tailor, leſt they ſhould tear, and give way. He muſt do the ſame on the other ſide. Then take the Second Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which we call the Brace-Roller, and tye it on each ſide to the Hood. Then take the Third, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Axillar Roller, carry it forward toward the Pap on the contrary ſide, and tye it with ſtrings. Then carry the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Roller from the <hi>Cubitus</hi> to the oppoſite <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> and tye it to the Doublet with ſtrings. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When he finds all things ſit, let him then looſe and untie the Rollers, and put off the Hood, and throw it back on the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Aſſiſtents muſt ſet the Chair ready and the Cloth. The Artiſt muſt rid himſelf of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance. The Patient muſt ſit right againſt the light of the window. The Aſſiſtent muſt tye the Cloth about the Patient's neck, to ſave the Blood from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down his Breaſt. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt muſt ſtand before the Patient, and appoint his Aſſiſtents their poſts.

For they muſt be often changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this operation blunts them much. The Aſſiſtent ſhould keep them, as much as he can, out of the Patient's ſight. He muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reach Rags and Lint to wipe the Wound. Before the Artiſt ſets upon Excoriation, he ought to conſider the breadth, depth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>renneſs of the Wound. And here take notice, that the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Wound affords the greateſt hope of Inſition. The Wound muſt be deep enough to bleed well, ſince Blood is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glew and Cement to unite the Parts. It muſt be even on the edges, without notches or angles, in an even line, but oblique. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Artiſt muſt put his Fore-finger into the Noſtril, to keep it ſteady for cutting. The outſide muſt be firſt cut in an even line, then he muſt go deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the inſide; and if at the end of the Wound any thing ſtick which cannot be taken off with a knife, he may clip it with a pair of Sciſſars, and ſo bring it to an evenneſs on the inſide. Then he muſt proceed to the cutting of the Graft, which he muſt not do at a venture, but in proportion to the curt Noſe, He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wipe the Wound, and clap a paper on the end of the Noſe, which may ſerve, when fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a pattern to cut the Graft by. Great exactneſs is required here. When he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Paper, let him give it to his Aſſiſtent. Let the Patient hold a linen Cloth to the Wound, to ſtop the Blood and keep out the Air. Then the Artiſt muſt open the Graft, and commit the Arm to one of his Aſſiſtents. Who muſt put his right Hand under the Elbow, and with his left keep the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and the Wriſt upright. The Artiſt muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Paper to the Graft, and well conſider how the Section muſt be made. Let him cut off what is ſuperfluous, let him take off the <hi>Callus</hi> within, and make it of an exact meaſure with the foregoing Section of the Noſe. Here the greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and exactneſs imaginable is required: For there is no room to amend a miſtake here. Then let him bring the Graft to the Noſe, and try whether they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſit, ſo that there may be neither eminency nor vacuity in the edges of the Wounds. And when they are exactly made fit,
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:52816:352"/>by taking away all unevenneſs, he muſt proceed to ſtitching. Where obſerve, that the ſtitches muſt be all at an exact diſtance in the Noſe, but both at leſs, and not at even diſtances in the Graft. When he goes to ſtitching the Noſe and the Graft, let him ſet the Patient on a Chair in a clear light, let him put on the Hood, and then the Roller, as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, over the Forehead, and faſten it behind in the Neck. This ſerves to ſtick the Needles on in order, to avoid confuſion after ſtitching when the threads are tied, leſt one might be taken for another. When this is done, let him paſs his Needle through the Parts; Firſt through the Graft, and then through the Noſe. But before he paſſes his Needle, he muſt mark out the ſtitches. Let him begin with one in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Graft, and then take the reſt equally on each hand of it. He muſt take care to obſerve juſt diſtances in his ſtitches, that all may exactly ſit; for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and ſpeed of Coalition, and the beauty of the Cicatrice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all upon exactneſs in ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Artiſt may begin his ſtitching, either on the right or left ſide of the Noſe, firſt paſſing the Needle through the Graft, then through the Noſe; let him bring it out directly towards the Forehead, and ſtick it in order on the Roller. When this is done, then comes the tying. But the Patient muſt firſt be laid in his Bed, leſt moving afterwards ſhould break or ſtretch the ſtitches. Firſt, the middle ſtitch muſt be tied, and then the reſt on either hand. The manner of it is thus. The Artiſt muſt turn the Arm into the poſture, we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he cut the Graft equal to the Noſe, he muſt bid the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent that holds the Patient's Head, to hold his Hand on the crown of his Head by the Wriſt, the other muſt keep the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and the Elbow ſteady, while a third takes up the Graft, and applies it to the curt Noſe. The Artiſt muſt with his left Hand take the end of the Thread that hangs out of the Graft, and with his right, the Needle that belongs to it. Then let him draw the Thread gently, and ſee whether it be that which he deſigns to tye or no, let him tye it once tight, and tye another ſingle knot, to keep it from ſlipping, and then cut off the thread almoſt at the knot. And thus let him do with the reſt in order. When this is done, he muſt dip the Tents in the Whites of Eggs, and put them into the Noſtrils, and then dip the Pledgets, and lay them on the Sutures outwardly. Then the Patient muſt be bound up with Rollers faſtned to his Cloaths, ſo that he cannot ſtir any way. Firſt of all, the Roller which faſtens the Wriſt to the crown of the Head, muſt be tied on each ſide with its ſtrings, then the Elbow, then the Axillar, and then the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Roller. I would adviſe the Artiſt himſelf to do this, and not to commit it to Servants, be they never ſo skilful. This done, let him adviſe his Patient to lie as ſtill as he can, not to ſtretch out, or pull his Arm, nor ſtir it any way, leſt it ſhould cauſe an
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:52816:353"/>Inflammation, which after ſo much ſlaſhing, ſtitching and tying, is apt enough to come of itſelf. Wherefore to avoid this, it would do well, for an hour and an half to clap ſome linen Cloaths dipt in Whites of Eggs and Roſe-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in equal quantities to the place of Inſition, changing them as they grow hot: For nothing is better to prevent an Inflammation. And ſo is Ingrafting performed.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MEdicaments, proper for the Cure of the Ingrafted parts, are of a middle nature between ſuch as cicatrize, and ſuch as incarnate: For they muſt be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moderately aſtringent, ſuch as <hi>Ebulus, ſambucus, ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis, palmae, pini, tedae cortices, draconii folia recentia, quae fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga gignit herba, anagall is, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, androſaemum, aſtragalus, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomunculus, telephium, ſymphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum petraeum, arancae tela, ſed ea praecipuè, cui è piſtrino pollen inſederit, (haec enim valentiùs exiccat) equiſetum, chamaepytis, arnogloſſum (quod in jungendis vulneribus nulli remediorum ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) iſatis, centaureum minus, folia pentaphylli, mumia, folia bederae recentia, gummi ceu hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor glutinoſus folliculis ulmi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſus, ceratum ex ceruſſa &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtrum barbarum.</hi> Thoſe are good for the Cure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wound; but that on the Inſide requires another courſe; for you muſt for three days at leaſt tent this with Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a little drier than ordinary, ſuch as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum ex Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholyge.</hi> It is good to ſtrew Myrrh, Frankincenſe, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's Blood powdered upon the ſtitches, to keep them from ouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When the Pledgets are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, it muſt be done with all gentleneſs; therefore they muſt be ſuppled with ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but ſparingly, leſt any moiſture ſhould inſinuate into the Inſition. Afterwards Linen Cloths ſpread with Medicines muſt be applyed outwardly, and Tents dipt in ſome inwardly, till the fourth day; and then we muſt proceed with Driers, as we ſaid before. This muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, that in dreſſing, they looſe the Elbow Roller ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully, eſpecially at the firſt, leſt the Inſition ſhould be ſeparated. Therefore an Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent muſt with all diligence keep the Patient's Arm in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſture. As to the ſtitches,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:52816:353"/>the time when they are to be looſed, is, when manifeſt tokens of Coalition do ſhew themſelves, which they do in Summer, and a dry Seaſon, on the third or fourth day; But in Winter and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, not till the fifth. It would be abſurd to looſe all the ſtitches at once. For thô the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Union ſhew themſelves in all parts; yet it is beſt to keep ſome ſtitches faſt, till all be more firmly united. You muſt begin to looſe them firſt, where the Union is not confirmed. This will be manifeſt, where the Part is drieſt. The fleſhy and upper Parts uſually unite the firſt. The lower, becauſe they are excar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and dependent, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moiſture that falls from above, are flower in uniting. Thô ſometimes it falls out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The ſtitches muſt be clipt with a pair of keen little Sciſſars, near the hole, and the thread muſt be drawn out by the knot. It would be improper to let the ſtitches alone till the Noſe were cicatrized; for ſo the lips of the holes would grow callous, and would never cicatrize, but the Marks would remain: All which is prevented by taking out the ſtitches in time. But where the ſtitches are taken out, we muſt apply Sarcoticks and Aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. The firſt ſtitches are taken out about the fourth day, and all the reſt before the ſeventh; for within that time the Parts do ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrize. When the ſtitches are thus taken out, apply dry Lint with <hi>Ceratum ex Pompholyge,</hi> till the fourteenth day, in which time the Parts unite and clcatrize, as their drineſs does moſt certainly teſtifie. The courſe of living is either low or midling: For the firſt week uſe a low, and for the ſecond, a midling Diet. All muſt be Spoon-meats, to avoid chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which would diſturb the Noſe. Keep quiet. Be chearful. And be moderate in Sleep and Watching.</p>

                        <p>How the Symptoms, attending Ingrafting, are to be corrected.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Symptoms attending this Operation, are either proper to the Ingrafting, or common to other parts. Symptoms proper to Ingrafting are Proud Fleſh and Excreſcence on the inſide, and gaping of the Suture. The Firſt is Nature's fault, the Second is the Artiſt's. Proud Fleſh ariſes in ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Bodies, and in cold and moiſt conſtitutions. We muſt not cicatrize, till this Proud Fleſh is taken away; and it may be taken away by Tents dipt in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Iſidis, Apoſtolorum,</hi> or <hi>Damaſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan,</hi> and put up the Noſe. If there be any gaping of the Suture, it was the Artiſt's careleſneſs in taking his ſtitches, that occaſioned it. The only Remedy is, to do it quite over again, as we directed in Inſition: For be it little or more that is amiſs, the caſe is the ſame, the Operation muſt be performed anew.</p>
                     <p>The next are the common Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, namely pain occaſioned by binding the Arm in the aforeſaid poſture, for which the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Patience, ſince it may not be looſed, nor can Medicaments be applied. Unleſs changing ſides to lie on may give a little eaſe. The pain in the Wriſt ariſes from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tied down to the Scull, upon a rough hood. The Remedy is to put Cotton under the Wriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Head. Thirſt, want of Sleep, and other general Symptoms may be cured in this, as in other caſes.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Cutting the Graft quite from the Arm, and how it muſt be Cured.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS ſoon as the curt parts are united with the Graft, it is time immediately to take it from the Arm, and to commit it to the new Stock. We muſt conſider therefore, when we may reckon them united, and ſo at what time the Graft muſt be cut off, then how it ought to be done, and how cured, and laſtly how Symptoms may be helped. The time of full unition is about the Twentieth day. Therefore we ſhould cut it off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Twenty days at the furtheſt. Somtimes in dry Weather, and a good Conſtitution, it may be done within a Fortnight or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>Before the Artiſt ſets upon the Operation, he muſt have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Whites of Eggs, and Roſewater with a little Powder of Dragon's Blood, to ſtop Bleeding; round Pledgets and Rollers both for the Arm and Noſe. Thoſe for the Arm muſt be of the ſame breadth and length as before. For beſides the new Ulcer, which ariſes upon cutting of the Graft, the whole Bed muſt be oovered, which it may with a plate of Lead and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicaments. The Roller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Noſe muſt have its ends long enough to tie behind the Head. It muſt be about four Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad. As ſoon as it reaches further than the Noſe, it muſt be divided into two, and ſo muſt have a double end on each Hand. Two of them muſt be tied above the Ears, upon the tip of the <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeides:</hi> And the other two muſt paſs under the Roots of the Ears, and be tied behind on the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Neck. But the ends on each Hand muſt croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the lower being tied above, and the upper below. This alſo muſt be obſerved, that where the Roller is whole, and lies upon the Graft, it muſt, about a Fingers breadth from the bottom, be cut tranſverſe, and another muſt be put under Perpendicular to it; ſo that it may reach no farther than the top of the other Roller. For when the Graft paſſes through this way, it does not turn up, but being preſt on each ſide makes way forward, ſo that gradually it receives the ſhape of a Noſe. There muſt be ſeveral ſquare pieces of Linnen in readineſs at the Fire upon occaſion of the Graft, as we ſhall ſhew by and by. Then there muſt be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp Knife or Raſor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to cut off the Graft. When all things are thus ready, let the Artiſt proceed to his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He muſt order two Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtents, one on his Right Hand by
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:52816:355"/>the Patient's Face and at the upper part of the Bed; the other on his Left, on the outſide of the Bed. Firſt, all the Rollers muſt be unti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Hood muſt be thrown off the Head upon the Shoulders; and while the Artiſt is about Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Aſſiſtents muſt keep the Arm in the ſame poſture, it was in before. He muſt take the Knife in his Right Hand, and apply his Left to the Graft. He muſt hold the Root of it between his Thumb on the outſide, and his Forefinger on the inſide, and with the Knife cut it off by the Root cloſe to the Arm. When this is done, three things remain: The firſt whereof, which is the Artiſt's part, is to dreſs the Graft: The other two, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bring back the Arm, and to dreſs the new Wound, belong to the Aſſiſtents. Theſe actions muſt not be divided. For each of them requires its Cure immediately; nor can the Artiſt apply himſelf to ſo many Operations all at once. Therefore theſe charges muſt be committed to ſeveral Perſons at one and the ſame time. And that every one may know what his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, we ſhall firſt proceed to the Cure of the Graft, which is the principal thing. But here two things give us a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one is the freſh Wound, the other is the refrigeration of the Graft, after its being cut off. This later is apt to affright People that are unexperienced in the affair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the very Moment that the Graft is cut off, they ſee it turn pale and white, and ſtiff and cold, as if all its heat were expired. But theſe fears preſently vaniſh, if we apply but warm Linen Cloths to the Graft, changing them for hot as they grow cold. How long this is to be done, is hard to determine, becauſe of the ſeveral Complexions of Mens Bodies; it ought to be continued till the Graft is revived, which we may know by its growing a little redder and more freſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured. Then clap on warm Cloths, and underneath ſome dipt in the Whites of Eggs, then bring the Roller over the Pledgets, and lye it behind the Head, as aforeſaid. As for the Aſſiſtents parts, he on the Leſt Hand muſt apply a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs dipt in Whites of Eggs to the freſh Wound; and if there is any Wound remaining in the Bed, he muſt apply its Medicaments, and roll it all over with a Roller, and ſew the end at laſt: For the Roller muſt not be tied on a knot. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dreſſing, it is adviſeable to draw the Arm from the Head, and bring it to a middle poſture: This muſt be done by degrees, and not at once. He that dreſſed it may moſt conveniently do it, by taking hold of the Patient's Elbow with his Right Hand, and of his Wriſt with his Left, and ſo bring it into its poſture. The other may put Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows underneath, and ſupport and gradually compoſe the Arm into a middle poſture. We will now ſay ſomthing further in reference to Cutting. We adviſed to cut off the Graft cloſe by the Arm, if it were but for the better cure of the Arm. If you think, that there will be more than needs of the Graft to ſupply the Noſe, you may either the very ſame day, or the next, cut off what you think will prove ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; but have a care that you take not too much away: For
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:52816:355"/>then the Noſe would ſtill be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. We muſt have a care like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we tye not the Graft too hard: For that might repreſs the Blood and ſo cauſe it to periſh. The Patient muſt live on a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diet, but eat little. He muſt have a care of cold and uncertain Weather, which often cauſes the Noſe to periſh.</p>

                        <p>Of Shaping the Graft, ſo as it may repreſent the Noſe.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE ſhaping of the Graft conſiſts principally in three things, <hi>viz.</hi> In forming the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and the Bridge, in its Inſition, and laſt of all in conforming the whole Graft according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Model. Nothing of this kind muſt be attempted, till four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days are over from the Graft's Cutting off, and then it will be time to begin this Operation. In the mean time the Graft muſt be carefully guarded by Medicaments and binding. Tents, as we ſaid before, muſt be dipt in <hi>unguentum ex ſuccis</hi> or <hi>ex pompholyge,</hi> either alone or mixt together, and put into the Noſtrils. But the end of the Graft, that is, the freſh Wound, requires Suppuration for the firſt Week; and the later Week <hi>unguentum ex ſuccis</hi> or <hi>de pompholyge</hi> may be applied. The Artiſt muſt alſo take care, that the external parts cicatrize neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He may accompliſh this by ſeveral means, of which I ſhall mention the moſt experienced and ſucceſsful. They are either Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters applied outwardly, or Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations uſed before the Plaiſters are applied. In Summer time <hi>ceratum diaphaenicinum</hi> and <hi>ex ceruſſa</hi> are proper. It will be better, both for the comelineſs of the Cicatrice, and the ſtrength of the part, if a little <hi>oleum de Beta</hi> be mixt with it. And this is no ordinary Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; ℞ <hi>Styrac. liqu.</hi> ℥ iiij. <hi>cerae flavae</hi> ℥ij. <hi>thuris, myrrhae, oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, ligni aloes à</hi> ℥ v. <hi>redigantur ſingula in tenuiſſimum pollineni, &amp; oleo amygd. dulc. recenti, &amp; cera cum reſinae, q. ſ. ex arte pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur ceratum.</hi> But before we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Plaiſter, we have often with good ſucceſs fomented the part with generous Wine warm, in half a Pint whereof five Grains of Musk were ſteept. The Graft may be fomented either with a Sponge or with Rags dipt in this Wine, which, when their warmth begins to fail, muſt be changed for new. For ſo the Pores are opened, and the Blood is drawn into the Graft. This done, the Artiſt muſt cover the whole Skin, and the Noſe alſo, a Fingers breadth, with his Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. In the Winter and Autumn

For becauſe the Graft muſt come as near the ſhape of the Noſe as may be, it is requiſite to make it gradually pliant, to bend it a little, and to form the Tip and the Bridge. In Nature's Model of the Noſe there are theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, the Length, the Tip, the Bridge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he <hi>Alae</hi> or ſides of the Noſtrils, and the Holes or Noſtrils themſelves. The length of the Noſe is reckoned to be the third part of the Face's length, namely the ſpac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> between the Tip-end of the Noſe to the middle of the <hi>interci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> is equal to that of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head from thence, and to the ſpace between the bottom of the Bridge, and the end of the Chin. The Tip is the round end of the Noſe. From hence the Bridge is inſerted tranſverſe to the upper Lip; and its length is the ſpace between that inſertion and the edge of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip. The proportion of the <hi>Alae</hi> or ſides is ſuch, as that they paſs on either ſide down to the upper Lip in the ſhape of an (S), only the bought is far larger where it deſcends to the upper Lip. The Holes or Noſtrils are of an Oval Figure, more acute towards the Tip, and more obtuſe towards the lower end. After this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Nature therefore muſt we always form the Cutaneous Graft, when ever the Bridge and the <hi>Alae</hi> are cut off. And if any part of them remains, the Graft muſt be formed proportionable. When therefore the Artiſt would ſhape the Noſe, having firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered its length, let him mark that part with Ink, which he deſigns for the Tip. Then let him mark the Confines of the <hi>Alae,</hi> from the <hi>Baſis</hi> to the Tip; and then mark the Bridge from the ſame Tip to the <hi>Baſis.</hi> When he has done this, let him conſider well, whether all things be exact, and then let him take his Knife, which muſt be very ſharp, and cut, as he had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Graft. But he muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this caution in the Section, to the Bridge he muſt cut in a right line, but towards the <hi>Alae</hi> in a bow, deep and oblique. He muſt put ſmall Tents dipt in Whites of Eggs into the Noſtrils,
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:52816:356"/>and he muſt bring the Bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Then he muſt put an orbicular Compreſs below the Noſe. This is done to keep the Bridge from ſtarting, and the Tents from ſlipping out. He muſt not take away theſe Tents till the next day. And take this for a rule in forming the Bridge, always take it long enough and broad enough; for one may take away from it, but can never add to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the two extreams the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is leſs dangerous than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The reaſon why the Bridge is cut in a ſtreight line, and the <hi>Alae</hi> in an oblique or ſloping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is becauſe this is beſt both for the Noſtrils and the Bridge. For whatever is taken from the thickneſs of the <hi>Alae,</hi> as much is added to the Amplitude of the Noſtrils. And we may do it the more boldly, becauſe proud Fleſh is apt to grow there. Beſides, when the Ulcer is healed, the Skin turns inwards, and ſo the circumference of the <hi>Alae</hi> being Skin and not a Cicatrice looks the handſomer. The reaſon why we Cut the Bridge ſtreight down, is, becauſe ſo it is the ſtronger, which would otherwiſe fade away. But the Cutaneous Graft muſt be well hollowed out towards the <hi>Alae,</hi> otherwiſe you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make a decent Noſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether there be proud Fleſh or any thing ſuperfluous of its ſubſtance, it muſt be taken away thus. The Patient muſt ſit againſt the light, and lean his Head back upon one of the Aſſiſtents. Then the Artiſt having turned up his Noſtrils, and diligently viewed whether there be any thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; if there be, he muſt take it away by little and little and very moderately with keen little Knives. He muſt repeat this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for upon Cutting, proud Fleſh is apt always to ariſe, the growth whereof muſt be checkt with Tents dipt either in <hi>unguentum iſidis</hi> or <hi>de pompholyge,</hi> and clapt into the Noſtrils, as ſoon as the proud Fleſh is taken away. Every day the Tents muſt be twice taken out and new ones dipt afreſh put in their room, having firſt wiped the Noſtrils with Cotton or ſoft Wool. Let the Artiſt have an Eye to the largeneſs of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and if it be not big enough, let him not fear to cut out enough to enlarge it, till the Graft be proportionable to Nature. To this action I can aſſign no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain term, I commit it to the Artiſt's prudence. Only let him take care, while he turns his Knife inward, that he no way hurt the Bridge. For its tender ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance could not bear it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſafeſt way is never to turn the edge of the Knife that way; but to begin the Section at the Tip, and when he is gone half way, to take the Knife out, and put it in at the Lip, and ſo make the Sections meet. For if he ſhould carry the Knife round and it ſhould ſlip, it might endanger the Bridge. You need not fear that this tormenting work will ſpoil the Graft; on the contrary the oftner it is Cut, the harder and ſtiffer it grows, when once it is Cicatrized. The time of Cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation is uncertain, ſomtimes three weeks (which is ſooneſt,) ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Forty, Fifty or Threeſcore
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:52816:357"/>days and above; according as the ſeaſon or the Patient's Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is hotter or colder, drier or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But this time needs not ſeem long, ſince the Patient may all this while go abroad, and live at his Liberty, provided he abuſe it not by exceſs. The warm Air cannot injure him, but a cold one may; wherefore in Winter and Autumn he muſt be the more careful.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Inſition of the Bridge.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter the Bridge and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Noſtrils are formed, and a <hi>Callus</hi> is bred, it will be time to ingraft the Bridge. The reaſons why we defer the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo long, are various. When the Bridge is ingrafted, we cannot turn up the Noſe, nor look into it, nor put a Knife deep, or with any ſafety into it, all which may very well be done, while the Graft is not inſerted into the upper Lip. Nor could it be done, till the Wounds on the ſides are healed. Beſides, ſhould the Bridge be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted before it were confirmed by a <hi>Callus,</hi> it would ſhrink, and draw down the Tip, and ſo make the Noſe imperfect. Therefore it is convenient, to defer it's Inſition till the thirty eighth day in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and till the ſixtieth in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Though ſometimes in each ſeaſon one may do it ſooner. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſet upon Ingrafting the Bridge, ſeveral things muſt be got ready, as a crooked Needle and a <hi>Forceps,</hi> which are peculiar to this Operation: Other things alſo, common to the Inſition of the Graft, are here requiſite, as ſharp Knives, Thread, Whites of Eggs mixt with Roſe-water, round Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, and Tents dipt in Whites of Eggs and Roſe-water. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe the <hi>Forceps,</hi> but when the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Bridge is quite gone. For then we muſt excoriate the Part which is to receive the Bridge; and this could never be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Inſtrument: For the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> would hinder one from doing it without the help of a <hi>Forceps</hi> to take up the Part. This <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> has two long handles, one with Notches, the other with a Ring fixt at the end, and another Ring running looſe in that, to ſlip over the Notches, and ſo to hold the <hi>Forceps</hi> tight. From the joint a circle ariſes, large enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the Parts about the mouth. From this divided in the middle, ariſe thin Plates with a blunt ſtreight edge ſharp-pointed, that they may the better be put into the Noſe. With this we muſt take up the Skin, and then cut it. The Needles muſt be bent Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular. It is good to have two or three of them in readineſs, tho' there be but occaſion for one, if
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:52816:357"/>that holds without breaking. There muſt be alſo a pair of Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, to clip a little off the Bridge, when part of it remains; for it will not bear cutting with a Knife, becauſe of it's acute ſenſe. When the Operation is undertaken, the Patient muſt ſit in a clear light againſt the Window, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſtanding right before him, muſt open his <hi>Forceps,</hi> and put it gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up the Noſe to the Circle. Then he muſt try to take up the Skin, which is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Bridge, between the Edges of the <hi>Forceps,</hi> ſo as that the preſſed Skin may ſtart out above the ſides of the <hi>Forceps.</hi> When he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it up, let him ſqueez the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi> and put the Ring upon the Handle to keep it faſt. Then let him cut off the <hi>Callus</hi> and the Skin, that ſtands up above the <hi>Forceps,</hi> with a ſmall ſharp Knife. He may leave off, when the Blood comes freely all over. Then he muſt take off the Ring, looſe the <hi>Forceps,</hi> and give it to the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent. But firſt let him take care to ſee, that the Wound of the <hi>Baſis</hi> correſponds to the bigneſs of the Bridge, before he looſe his <hi>Forceps.</hi> For it is far better, that the Wound ſhould be larger, rather than leſs, than the Bridge; becauſe the largeneſs of the Wound is the ground of Unition, and if it be larger than needs, it is no great matter, ſince the Cicatrice is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Noſe. But when the Bridge is not quite gone, but part remains, he muſt then take a pair of Sciſſars and clip it off at once, as much as needs, which, if it were cut, would put the Patient to intolerable pain. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excoriation, or clipping, the end of the Bridge (or if it be too long, a little more) muſt be cut off. Effuſion of Blood terminates this operation, as before. The reaſon, why we excoriate the <hi>Baſis</hi> firſt, and then the Bridge, is, leſt if we ſhould cut the Bridge firſt, the Blood falling down might hinder the other operation. When things are thus adminiſtred, the Artiſt muſt take the Needle in his right hand at the middle, and paſs it in at the top of the <hi>Philtrum</hi> (or the dent in the upper Lip,) or, if the bottom of the Bridge be ſtanding, underneath that, till it comes out at the upper part of the Wound on the other ſide; when he ſees the Needle appear, let him thruſt it further; but with his left hand let him hold the Noſe aſide, that he hurt it not; and then taking hold of the Needle with his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, let him draw it quite out, with a little piece of the thread. When he has done this, let him wipe the Needle, that it ſlip not out of his Fingers, and let him take the Bridge by the end, and paſs his Needle through that, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good hold, leſt the holes ſhould break. Then he muſt tye the thread, and cut off the ends. When he has done ſtitching, let him put in the Tents, and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Compreſſes. He muſt apply the uſual Plaiſter to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Noſe, and then bind all carefully up. Let the Patient keep himſelf quiet for one day, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Bed, or at leaſt in the Houſe. It would not be amiſs to cut ſhort his Diet till the fourth day; about which time, eſpecially in warm weather, ſigns of Unition appear.
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:52816:358"/>Wherefore then abouts it will be proper to take out the ſtitches. But in cold weather, and in moiſt Bodies, not till the ſixth day. As to the reſt of the Cure, you have it before in the Cure of the Graft. Every day it muſt be dreſt with Tents dipt in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum ex pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholyge,</hi> or with ſuch things as were applied to the Graft, dry Lint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, after the ſtriches are taken out, muſt be continued till the Parts are ſtrongly united.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The further Conformation of the cutaneous Graft.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>VVHen the Bridge is firmly united, which in Summer is about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, and in Winter about the twentieth, the care of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation enſues, which is a conſtant molding of the whole Subſtance of the Graft into the ſhape of the Noſe. For though by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Configuration, the cutaneous Graft has in a good meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſhape of a Noſe; yet it falls far ſhort, both in ſolidity and ſhape; becauſe as yet it is but ſoft and flaccid, and has little in it of the grace of a Noſe. For hitherto it has had enough to do to live; but now that the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are over, it begins to provide for it's own ſtrength, and to be clear of another nature. Now the Tip begins to have life in it, and the Noſtrils being ſtrengthened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with a Cicatrice, the whole Noſe grows more compact and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. But this will not be complete till a long time, according to the diverſities of Bodies, and of the ambient Air. This laſt Work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon two ſorts of Means, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Tubes inwardly and a Cover outwardly, made in the ſhape of a Noſe, wherewith the cutaneous Graft being guarded in it's tender Age, may inſenſibly grow into the ſhape of a Noſe. As for the Tubes, their Figure is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, oblong, and unequal. It is circular, but not exactly, for where it comes to the Bridge it is flattiſh. It is broader below to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Alae,</hi> and narrower above towards the root of the Noſe, growing narrower by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Below, they turn back a little, and take hold of the <hi>Alae,</hi> and towards the Tip they run out like a Myrtle-leaf. They alſo in a ſtreight line encloſe the Bridge, meeting like two Boards exactly plained. Their length is unequal, for on the upper ſide, towards the ridge of the Noſe, they run out farther in length, (to compreſs thoſe Parts as they ſwell with proud Fleſh,) than on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide, where there is no heed of them. Wherefore that end comes ſloping downwards. But on both ſides they muſt be equal
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:52816:358"/>in Bulk, Length, and Figure, not too big or long, ſo as to ſqueeze the Bridge and kill it; nor too little or ſhort, ſo as not to be able to repreſs proud Fleſh, and help the <hi>Callus.</hi> At firſt they muſt be made of Lead very thin; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as the <hi>Callus</hi> comes on, a little thicker, which it uſually does in three months from the time of Coalition. But when the Noſe is a little hardned, they muſt be made of a ſtiffer ſubſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Silver or Gold. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt be of the ſame ſubſtance with the Tubes, either of Lead, Silver or Gold, according to the time. As ſoon as ever we uſe the Tubes, this muſt be applyed to the Noſe. It muſt be of the exact ſhape of a Noſe. It muſt cover the tip and the <hi>Alae,</hi> and then run down the Bridge to the upper Lip. But holes muſt be left in it for the <hi>Tubuli</hi> to ſtick out, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. The Cover muſt come up above the Inſition, and reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bony Part, to keep all the firmer, and to defend the Cicatrice from external Injuries. It muſt be lined with Silk or thin Cloth, and the Lining muſt be changed every, or every other, day. Though this Lining is not needful in hot and dry weather. The Cover is kept on with five Strings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of four are in pairs and one ſingle; the ſingle one runs up juſt between the Eyebrows, along the Forehead, and the <hi>Sagittal</hi> future behind the Crown of the Head, underneath which it is faſtned behind to the other Strings. The upper of the lateral Strings comes from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Cover, paſſes the Cheeks and the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> and ſo above the Ear, and is faſtned with it's oppoſite upon the <hi>Occiput</hi> at the tip of the <hi>Lambdoeides,</hi> and to this is the ſingle ſtring faſtned; ſo the lower lateral ſtrings come like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the middle of the Cover, and are carried croſs the Cheeks under the Ears, and are tied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the nape of the Neck. The ſtrings ſhould be of Silk, about a Finger broad. Rings muſt be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Cover, whereto the ſtrings muſt be faſtned. Now we will ſhew, how the Cover is to be tied on. We muſt conſider, that in the tip of the Noſe there is a dent; wherefore it muſt be bound tight to the Graft there, that it may repreſent a Noſe. For this purpoſe, leſt the ſtring ſhould ſlip any way, we have faſtned a Ring to the top of the Noſe, through which this ſtring muſt paſs. We have added two more in the ſides, through which ſtrings muſt paſs thence along under the Ears, and tie behind in the Neck, to keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cloſe down to the Noſe. This Cover makes the Cicatrice even, and repels the Humors from it. By theſe two things, the Tubes and Cover, is the faſhioning of the Noſe completed. They ſhould be uſed for two years; and if towards the later end they grow irkſome, the Cover may be left off in the day time (but not the Tubes,) and put on again at night. And becauſe ſtrings may fret the Fleſh, the Cover may be tied on with a Roller, eſpecially in the night time. It muſt be long enough to the behind, and broader than the Cover, ſo as it may comprehend the Cover, the Tip, and the <hi>Alae.</hi> That part which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And thus is the whole Art of Engrafting a new Noſe fully deſcribed. Only it remains, that we inform you, how the Colour and Cicatrice of the Noſe may be amended. There is nothing better than, in the heat of Summer, for an hour or an hour and a half, to ſir with your Noſe againſt the hot Sun. Do this every day for a good while together. And the heat and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſtrangely confirm the <hi>Callus,</hi> and add to the beauty of the Noſe.

                        <p>Of Curing the Hare-Lip, and ſupplying a Lip defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>LIps are curt, or deficient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Birth, and then they are called Hare-Lips, or by accident without loſs of ſubſtance, and then they are called curt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catricoſe; or laſtly, they are truly curt, where ſubſtance is deficient. And only theſe laſt need engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But firſt we will begin with the Hare-Lip, becauſe this is the moſt ſimple evil, and eaſieſt to cure. If both Lips be ſuch, the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:52816:359"/>ſame method of cure muſt be uſed for both. And what that ſhould be, the nature of the Diſeaſe ſhews, namely, the ſeparation of thoſe parts which ſhould be joyned. Somthing indeed ſeems to be loſt, and ſo there ſeems ſomthing to be needful to ſupply the place of what is loſt. But we may very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our end, and perform a cure, without the ſuperaddition of any thing. Now that the disjoyned parts, which ought to be entire, ſhould be united, the ſeat of the Diſeaſe indicates. And this work of unition is owing firſt to Nature and then to Art, which removes what hinders Nature, and aſſiſts her in her Operations. It is Art's task, to excoriate the parts, and keep them cloſe together, that they may unite in their Blood, to ſew them when united, to keep them ſewed, and to reduce them to a right temper and health. Let the Artiſt therefore take up that part of the Lip, which muſt be excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, in his Left Hand, and then take off the Skin equally with a very ſharp Knife, till the Blood comes, to the very Angle of the <hi>Hiatus,</hi> and then he muſt ſmooth the Wound. This Operation may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be performed very quickly and ſafely with a pair of Sciſſars. The ſame muſt be done on the other ſide. Then he muſt draw the parts together with his Hand, and ſtitch them. We muſt obſerve this, not to take our ſtiches ſuperficially, but thorow all. The Artiſt muſt therefore paſs his Needle ſtreight through the Lip from the outſide inwards, and on the other ſide he muſt paſs the Needle from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide outwards. He muſt tie the threads and faſten the ends, and then cut them off. He muſt take his ſtitches not too near the edges of the Wound, but at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, leſt the hold ſhould break. The number of the ſtitches is beſt defined by the amplitude of the Wound. After ſtitching is done, ſome compreſſes, dipt in Whites of Eggs and Roſewater, muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied both to the inſide and outſide of the Wound. Then a thin, ſoft, and even Roller of about three Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth, dipt in <hi>Poſca,</hi> muſt be brought along obliquely above the Ears, and muſt be tied tightly behind the Head. A piece of Linen Cloth alſo, dipt in mild <hi>Poſca,</hi> muſt be applied to the inſide of the Lip, to defend it likewiſe from Fluxion. Within a day or two the compreſſes muſt be removed, and congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants muſt be applied. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide may have ſuch things applied to it, as are mentioned before in the cure of a curt Noſe, as with Lint and <hi>unguentum ex ceruſſa,</hi> and a Plaiſter of <hi>ceratum ex ceruſſa</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied over it. But the Medicaments for the inſide are <hi>Srrupus ex roſis ſiccis, ſyrup. myrtin.</hi> and where there is much foulneſs, <hi>julep. vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum</hi> or <hi>mel roſaceum.</hi> Theſe uſed either alone or mixt haſten Coalition. It will do well to add a little <hi>pollen myrrhae</hi> to them. ℞ <hi>Syr. roſ. ſicc.</hi> ℥ j. <hi>Mell. roſ.</hi> ℥ v. <hi>pollinis thuris</hi> ℈ j. <hi>M.</hi> We muſt ſpread a rag with it, and apply it often to the inſide of the Lip. About the beginning of the fourth day we muſt looſe ſome of the ſtitches, where the parts ſeem beſt united. But then it is beſt to keep the parts together with a glew, which may ſtick, till there is a perfect Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:52816:360"/>And as ſoon as the Glew ſticks, the ſtitches may be looſed. <hi>Flos calcis</hi> with the white of an Egg is a good Glew. You may uſe this. ℞ <hi>Gum. tragac. maſtic. Arab. thur. an.</hi>

Two Linen Cloths muſt be got, double, and about three Fingers long, and as broad as the Lip, with threads faſtened at ſmall, but equal, diſtances in both, as many on the one ſide as on the other. They muſt be ſpread with the Glew, and the ends, where there are no Threads, muſt be applied wet to the Lip. With this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that the Threads meet at four Fingers diſtance from the outmoſt edge of the Linen Cloths, and that the ends of the Linen Cloths be an Inch at leaſt from the edge of the Wound. About ſix hours after the Glew is applied, (in which time it faſtens to the Lips,) we muſt tye the Threads gently. You may know they are cloſe enough tied, when the Lips of the Wound meet, and when there is no pain. Then we muſt dreſs the Wound with drying Liniments, ſuch as we uſed to the Bed. While he does this, the Artiſt muſt looſe the Threads, wipe the Wound and apply Medicaments, then he muſt tie the Threads again, apply a thin Cloth, and then a Roller. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> be done twice a day, for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, in which time the edges of the Wounds will be ſtrongly united. But I would adviſe the Patient, that, when he goes to Bed, he would apply <hi>ceratum ex ceruſſa,</hi> and bind it with a Roller. He may likewiſe uſe the ſame things here as in the Cicatrice of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted Noſe.</p>
                     <p>When a Lip is curt Cicatricoſe, the <hi>Callus</hi> muſt be quite cut away, which you may know to be done by the bleeding every where. That day it muſt be dreſt with Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſtop Blood, and after that with ſuppuraters. The Lip muſt be brought into its proper place. Which that you may do, you muſt fold a Linen Cloth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in manner of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, you may lay Medicaments on it, and keep the Lip higher or lower, as is fit, and then faſten all with a Roller. After Seven days, Sarcoticks and Epuloticks muſt be uſed. A thick leaden plate of the ſhape of a Lip, with Medicines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, may be applied. And when it is cicatrized, the buſineſs is done. It will be beſt not to leave off the leaden Plate too ſoon; but to wear the ſame in the Night and tie it on faſt. For ſo in time it will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, without any fear of breaking open again.</p>
                     <p>When a great part of the Lip is wanting, it cannot be ſupplied without a Graft. Therefore I would adviſe him, that intends this Operation, diligently to peruſe what has before been ſaid in engrafting the Noſe. For the delineation of the Graft is exactly the ſame, and the taking of it up partly the ſame, (namely, when the upper Lip is to be ſupplied,) and partly different,
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:52816:360"/>when the under Lip is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: For then the Graft muſt be cut off at the end next the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. Moreover, the method of Cure is the ſame from the taking up of the Graft till it's Inſition. Only you muſt take care, that the <hi>Callus</hi> be well grown on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Graft. For the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that comes from the Gums, hinders the healing of that Part very much. Inſition muſt be made with crooked Needles; and the Stitches both in the Graft and Lip muſt be at equal diſtances. Nor muſt the Graft be cut from it's Stock, till it is well united with the curt Parts, which it is in Summer within Four and twenty days after Inſition; but much a longer time is required in Winter and cold weather. The method for Conformation muſt be ſuch as the ſubſtance of the Lip requires. This will be much holpen by bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which muſt be with a Roller carried above the Ears for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip, and underneath for the lower Lip: Or, with a double-headed Roller, when both the Lips are to be bound. A plate of Lead will be alſo as neceſſary for the Lip, as it was to cover the Noſe. And this may ſuffice for the Cure of curt Lips.</p>

                        <p>Of Supplying curt Ears.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE buſineſs of ſupplying a curt Ear conſiſts in taking up the Graft, in Engrafting, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Forming of it. Here the Graft is not taken from the Arm, as it was for the Noſe and Lips, but from the Region adjacent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ear. It is at one and the ſame time delineated, taken up, and engrafted. There muſt be in readineſs Knives, Needles, Thread, Whites of Eggs mixt with Bole Armenick and <hi>Terra ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata,</hi> and Compreſſes. Two things are peculiar to this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz. Goſſypium uſtulatum,</hi> to ſtop Blood upon cutting the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and a Roller to go along by the Ears under the Chin, which muſt tye on the Crown of the Head: The <hi>Baſis</hi> of it, that is, the Part below the Ears, which goes under the Chin, is whole; but from the Roots of the Ears, or lower, it is parted into two, the Part toward the Face, is called the Fore-part, and the Part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, the Hind-part. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind keeps on the Dreſſings, and the Fore-part is aſſiſtent to it in keeping all faſt. The place whence the Graft muſt be taken, is the place behind the Ear without hair. The dimenſion of the Ear will ſhew the quantity of the Graft. It is beſt here alſo to take it large enough. The curt Parts muſt be carefully ſcarified all over, and the Graft muſt be ſtitcht to the Part, beginning at the <hi>Concha in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna</hi> where the Skin riſes from the Head, and not at the <hi>Helix
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:52816:361"/>externa.</hi> The Paſſage of the Ear muſt be ſtopped with Cotton. But firſt of all the bleeding of the Artery, when the Graft is raiſed, muſt be ſtopt with <hi>Goſſypium uſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi> and Compreſſes wet in Whites of Eggs, and Roſe-water muſt be applyed to the Bed, and great care muſt be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Inflammation, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clothes about the Neck wet in <hi>Poſca,</hi> and changing them as they grow warm. The Patient muſt live very temperate, and uſe Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat to avoid chewing. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time on the third day the Wound may be opened, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes may be removed; but this may not be done till a Caruncle is grown at the end of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to plug it up. When theſe are taken away, the Bed muſt be treated with Suppuraters for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days as formerly, And the Graft muſt be exiccated carefully, both in the Coalition, and on the back-ſide where the Wound is, which muſt turn to perfect <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> The very ſame Medicaments are proper here as in the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. One thing muſt be taken care of, that the holes of the ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he filled with ſtrewing on ſome Powder: And they muſt be looſed in order, as formerly has been directed. Bolſters muſt be put between the Head and the Graft, which may both keep it in the ſhape and poſture of an Ear. The Artiſt muſt have a care of the proud Fleſh that riſes in the Bed, eſpecially about the Root of the Graft, which Part is long in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As for the Medicaments, what they are, and when they ſhould be changed, what the Symptoms are, and how they ſhould be cured, you may find all in the foregoing Diſcourſe <hi>Of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a curt.

               <head>AN APPENDIX OF THE Venereal Diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THat, we call the Venereal Diſeaſe, with whoſe Name one Nation now upbraids another, was firſt brought from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe Ann. Dom.</hi> 1493. and till then was not ſo much as known by name to our Parts of the World. At it's firſt arrival it was attended with tremendous Symptoms; but within an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years laſt paſt, they have been in ſome meaſure changed, and much altered. Within the ſaid time, and at the preſent, it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhews it ſelf firſt by a virulent <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> only now and then a Shanker gives the firſt Notice of the Diſeaſe. But when it does not diſcharge it ſelf by a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> it quickly infects the maſs of Blood.</p>
               <p>This Venereal Diſeaſe is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated either by <hi>deſcent</hi> from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their Children; or by <hi>contact of ſome ſoft Part,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Virulence and Inflammation are inſinuated into the Body upon the Occaſions following. Firſt, in ſucking, <hi>viz.</hi> either the Child infects the Nurſe by the open Pores of the Nipples; or the Nurſe the Child by it's tender Mouth Secondly, Children may get it by lying naked in the ſame Bed with infected Perſons: For though adult Perſons can ſcarce contract it without impure Coition, albeit they lye in Bed together; yet Childrens fleſh, being of a more lax and rare texture, is eaſily ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of the venom from infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Perſons. Thirdly, the moſt uſual way of contracting it is by impure Coition. The moſt uſual ſigns of the Taint, are a <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> Shankers, Inflammation, and heat of Urine. So long as it goes no further than a <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> it falls far ſhort in Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a confirmed Pox, when the whole maſs of Blood, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the Body are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Therefore the Cure of a Clap and of the Pox is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>In a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> therefore (or, as the Town calls it, a Clap,) the ſtreſs of the Cure lies upon purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eſpecially with ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as carry off bile and ſerous Humors. A Cooling Diet alſo muſt be preſcribed all along. This is a
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:52816:362"/>good Purge, ℞ <hi>Maſſ. pil. coch. m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Doſe of theſe Pills is four, to be taken every Morning about four or five a Clock, (ſo that the Patient may ſleep upon them,) for Twelve or Fourteen days or longer, if there ſhall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that is, till the heat of Urine, and the yellowneſs of the Running are gone; which when it has ſucceeded according to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, the Patient may take the Pills every other day for a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night longer; then he may take them twice a Week, till the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is quite ceaſed: For there is danger in the leaſt Gleet, if one ceaſe purging, before that is gone. If Pills will not do, you may try a Potion and Clyſters. It is good to give Twenty five drops of Balm of <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ead</hi> in Sugar, or the quantity of a Wallnut of Turpentine every Night at Bed-time. In the mean while the Patient muſt abſtain from all Salt Meats. He may eat Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Veal, Chicken, Rabbet, or any food eaſie of Digeſtion. He muſt drink no Wine nor ſtrong Drink, nor any ſowre Liquor. His Drink may be Water boiled three parts, and Milk one in four; only at Meals he may drink a draught of ſmall Beer. Emulſions of the cold Seeds are good to allay Heat of Urine and Inflammation in the intervals of Purging. After a Month is over, and not ſooner, it will be proper to bleed a Sanguine Conſtitution. Injections are not very ſafe; only toward the later end an Injection of Roſe-Water may be uſed. This courſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſucceeds: For the Cure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon good Purging; if ſo be the Patient drink not the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for they are injurious. If the Prepuce ſwell, uſe Emollient Fomentations, Oyntments and Plaiſters. If the <hi>Scrotum</hi> ſwell, uſe a Cataplaſm of Oxycrate and Bean-Flower. And this method may do well enough for a Clap.</p>
               <p>But when the Diſeaſe has got footing, ſo that it may deſerve the name of a confirm'd Pox, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way (as Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> ſays,) is, to ſalivate; which may be done thus: ℞ <hi>Axungiae porcinae</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Mercurii crudi</hi> ℥ j. <hi>M.</hi> With this let the Patient himſelf chaſe his Arms, Thighs and Legs, with his own Hands for three Nights one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. Let him have a care, the Unguent come neither at his Armpits, Groin, nor Belly. He may tie a Flannel therefore about his Belly and Back, to ſecure it. On the morrow after the laſt anointing, give of <hi>Turbith. miner. gr.</hi> viij. <hi>in conſerva roſar. rubr.</hi> After the third anointing, or at leaſt after giving of the <hi>Turbith,</hi> the Gums begin to ſwell, and the party Spits. In the mean time, it is the Phyſician's part to carry on the Salivation with Judgment and an even hand, leſt, by raiſing it too high, he endanger Life. When the Salivation is come to the height, (at which time two quarts of Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are diſcharged in four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours,) or when the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, thô the Patient ſpit little, are vaniſht, (which uſually happens about four days after the Salivation is at the height,) his Shirt and Sheets, in which he lay before, muſt be changed: Becauſe they,
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:52816:362"/>being dawbed with the Unguent, may carry on the Salivation too far. But if the Salivation fail, before the Symptoms diſappear, it muſt be quickened now and then with a Scruple of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> in a Doſe. If upon the <hi>Mercury</hi>'s get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Blood, the Gripes enſue, you muſt hold your Hand, and uſe no more <hi>Mercury</hi> either inwardly or outwardly, till they are ſtopt; which is done by giving now and then a Drachm and an half of <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> and by ſetting the Patient on an empty cloſe Stool over a Fume of Cephalick Herbs, boyl'd in <hi>Canary</hi> Wine. When the Patient begins to recover, you muſt not ſtop the Salivation either by Purgers or diet Drinks: For ſuch ſtopping of it often occaſions a Relapſe. Only when the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation riſes too high, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by a Purge. When the Mouth is much exulcerated in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation, it may be often waſht Night and Day with <hi>aqua roſarum Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcenarum,</hi> or with <hi>Lac aquae permiſtum,</hi> or with <hi>decoctum hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei, radie alth. &amp; ſem.

               </p>
               <p>That the Hebrews had the Art of Embalming, is apparent from Scripture: For <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.2. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph commanded his Servants the Phy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>icians to embalm his Father: And the Phyſicians embalmed</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. It is very probable, they learned the Art from the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that in proceſs of time they loſt it. For if we conſider the maner of Embalming among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is deſcribed by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and as it was uſed about the death of Chriſt, it looks more like a reſpectful Ceremony paid to the dead, than any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from Corruption. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> words are theſe: <hi>The manner in</hi> Iſrael <hi>about the dead and their burial, is this, when any one is dead, they cloſe his Eyes, and and if his Mouth be open, they keep it ſhut with a Muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ler, tied about his Jaws. The place alſo by which the Excrements are voided, is ſtopt up, but it is done after the Body is waſht. Then he is anointed with Ointments made of ſeveral ſorts of Spices, and, after the Head is ſhaved, the Body is wrapt in white Linen Shrouds made for this purpoſe, which are of no great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, that a mean may be kept between the rich and the poor.</hi> After this manner, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was <hi>Lazarus</hi> embalured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his burial, he being none of the meaneſt Jews; and yet <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> feared he would ſtink in four days time.</p>
               <p>But the accuracy of Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is owing undoubtedly to the Aegyptians. The beſt account whereof, now extant, we find in <hi>Herodotus. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hiſtor. Euterp.</hi>
His words are theſe; <q>Then they carried the dead Party to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed. There are certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed on purpoſe to perform this Artifice; who, when the Corps is brought to them, ſhew to thoſe that bring it, wooden Moulds in the ſhape of the dead. They ſay one ſort of them is moſt curiouſly wrought. A Second is meaner and cheaper. And a Third is of a very ſmall value. When they have ſhewn theſe Moulds, they ask, in which Mould they will have their Dead put. When they are agreed of a price, they depart. And they, with whom the Dead is left, do Embalm the Body very careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this manner. Firſt of all, with a crooked Iron they draw out all the Brain through the Noſe, and ſo fill up the place with Medicaments: Then with an Aethiopick ſtone they cut about the <hi>Ilia,</hi> and that way they take out all the Paunch; which, when they have cleanſed and filled with Phoenician Wine, they ſtuff again with beaten Spices; then filling the Cawl with pure Myrrh and <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and other Spices (except Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,) they few it up again. When they have done this, they ſalt it up cloſe ſeventy days, for they may not ſalt it longer. After ſeventy days are over, when they have waſh'd the Corps, they wrap it in fine Linen cut into ſlips, laying on a Gum, which the Aegyptians commonly uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Glew. When the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is reſtored to the Relations.
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:52816:363"/>they make a wooden Coffin in the ſhape of a Man, into which they put the dead, and entomb him. But they that would ſave charges, prepare the Body thus; They give a Clyſter of Oil of Cedar. Then after this they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut nor draw the Belly of the Dead; but fill it by the Vent, and ſalt it the aforeſaid number of days; on the laſt of which days they draw out the Oil of Cedar, which they had put in, which is of ſuch Virtue, that it brings the Guts waſted along with it. And Nitre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the fleſh, and leaves only the Skin and Bones. When they have done this, they reſtore the Dead, and do nothing further. The third way of Embalming is for the poorer ſort; They cleanſe the Guts by Purging, and dry the Body with Salt for ſeventy days; and then they reſtore it. And if an Aegyptian or a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be either kill'd by a Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, or drown'd in the River, the City, where he is caſt up, muſt embalm him, and bury him Honourably in the Sacred Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whom no one, no not a Relation or Friend, but only the Prieſts of <hi>Nile,</hi> may touch; becauſe they bury one who is ſomthing more than a dead Man.</q> Now, thô, in this account of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> one cannot eaſily imagine, how the Brain could be got ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the coſtly way, they uſed as well out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly for anointing and dipping the linen Shrowds in, as for ſtuffing the three Ventricles, divers aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Spices, which, by their innate Balſamick Virtue, by their bitterneſs alſo, and oleous Sulphur, or the penetrability of their vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt, reſiſt putrefaction; and by their ſweet Smell prevent ſtench and offenſiveneſs; ſuch as <hi>Opobal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamum,</hi> Oil of Cedar, Aloes, Myrrh, Saffron, Cinamon, <hi>Caſſia, &amp;c.</hi> This was for the Rich.

The Heart may be embalmed apart, according to the Relations pleaſure. The Skull muſt be ſawn aſunder, and the Brain muſt be taken out. Then deep gaſhes muſt be made along the Arms, Legs, Thighs, Back, Loins and Buttocks, eſpecially where the larger veins and arteries run along; Firſt, that the Blood may be got out, which otherwiſe might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion corruption; Secondly, that there may be place to put in the Spices. Then the Body muſt be waſh'd with a Sponge dipt in <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> and ſtrong Vinegar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Wormwood, Aloes, Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, common Salt, and Alume have been boiled. Afterwards, theſe gaſhes, all the paſſages, and openings, and the three Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles muſt be filled with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Spices groſly powdered. ℞ <hi>pulv. roſar. chamaen. melilot. balſam. menth. ſalv. lavandul. rorismarin. majoran. thym. abſinth. cyper. calam. aromat. gentian. ireos Florent. aſſae odoratae, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophyll. nucis moſch. cinnam. ſtyrac. calam. benzo. myrrh. alo. ſantal. omnium q. ſ. f. pulvis.</hi> The gaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and open places muſt be ſewed up, that the Powders ſhake not out. Then the whole Body muſt be anointed with Turpentine melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oil of Chamemel and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; adding, if you pleaſe, ſome Chymical aromatick Oils; and beſtrew it again with the foreſaid Powder. Then wrap it in Linen, and after that in Cere-cloth. And put it into a leaden Coffin well ſodered, and filled with aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Herbs. But if none of the ſaid Spices can be got, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when Towns are beſieged; you muſt be content with powder of ſlak'd Lime, and common aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſuppoſe Oak. For thus, if the Body be waſh'd in ſtrong Vinegar, or <hi>Lixivium,</hi> it will keep a long time, provided the ſeaſon be not very hot, nor that it be laid in a hot and moiſt place. To embalm the better, it is a good way to prick the Body, when embowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with ſharp Bodkins, that the Liquor preſerving it from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, may penetrate the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When it is prickt, it muſt be laid in a wooden Tray, fill'd with a decoction of Vinegar, and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and bitter things, as Aloes, Rue, Wormwood, and Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, and it muſt be kept there Twenty days, pouring upon it ſix quarts of <hi>Aquavitae.</hi> Then ſet it upright in a cloſe and drie place.</p>

I have embalmed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in the following me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, upon which I now alſo inſiſt.

The Head I embalm thus; I ſeparate the Skull circularly with a very ſharp Saw, or I open it only from the Crown towards the <hi>Occiput;</hi> then I take out the Brain, and waſh the Cavity in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as I did the Belly; Firſt, with cold water, then with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and laſt of all very well with <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis;</hi> then I wipe it with Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and fill it with the Powder and Tow. When I have cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jaws well with a Syringe, I fill them with powder of Cloves and Cinnamon; I plentifully and iteratedly anoint the Face with Balſame of <hi>Peru,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomonis.</hi> Then I divide the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and carnous parts with deep inciſions, eſpecially about the Buttocks, and, having care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſqueezed out the Blood, I beſtrew them with the Powder hereafter deſcribed.

In VVinter it may be performed in a Room with a Fire of Aſh, Oak, or Juniper in it; but not in a Stove. He that goes about this work, muſt take ſome Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacks, whereby he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Heart and Brain againſt hurtful Exhalations. Let him anoint his Noſtrils with ſome Balſam, or hold to them a Sponge impregnate with Bezoardick Vinegar. Let him hold in his Mouth ſome <hi>trochiſci de zedoaria, de corticibus citri,</hi> or ſome other preſervative. Or, if he have none of theſe things, let him take ſome Meat, or a Mouthful of Bread dipt in Wine. I think, it is better to begin with opening the Lower Belly, than the middle; and that it is beſt to abſtain from quick-lime, and other corroſive things: Becauſe Bodies are not kept but conſumed by ſuch things.

               <p>But the greateſt Maſter in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming in our Age, was <hi>Bilſius,</hi> who held ſtrange opinions about the Lymphatick, Lacteal, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racick Veſſels, and about his <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Roriferus;</hi> wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the moſt famous Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts of his time, <hi>Bartholine, Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Van Horne.</hi> He had found out a method of Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Bodies without effuſion of Blood, after a new and unheard of manner, with an accurate ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manifeſt demonſtration, of all the parts and little Veſſels, thô they were leſs than Hairs. But he was chiefly skilled in a new and curious way of Embalming Dead Bodies, after they were opened or diſſected, replacing the embalmed Bowels in their Natural places, <hi>viz.</hi> The Brain in the Skull, and the Guts in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and more than that, not any embalming Spices ſtuck to the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Theſe new ſecrets of his drew the King of <hi>Spain</hi> into ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him, that, by his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Low Countries, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Twenty Thouſand Crowns to be paid him, upon condition that he ſhould declare ingenuouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath to the three Eſtates of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> his admired Art; and he, as an Honorary Proſeſſor in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Lovain,</hi> ſhould teach Anatomy publickly according to his Manual Operation, for which he was to have a Penſion of Two Thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum;</hi> and he was alſo obliged to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his ſaid peculiar method to ſome skilful Anatomiſt, that after his Death it might be perpetuated for the good of the publick and of Phyſicians. And thô <hi>Bilſius</hi> had got ſo vaſt a Sum of Money, and went to <hi>Lovain,</hi> to perform his agreement; yet the Univerſity of <hi>Lovain</hi> made bold to refuſe him a reception into the Society of the Profeſſors, upon this pretence, that <hi>Bilſius</hi> being of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it might in ſo doing lay it ſelf obnoxious to an Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the See of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Next to <hi>Bilſius</hi> comes <hi>Clander,</hi> who, after various Experiments, gives us this proceſs for Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after the Body deſigned for Embalming has been dead Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, or at the moſt Twenty four Hours, let it be laid in a long Tray of Oak, or of ſome hard Wood. Then get ready ſome <hi>Spiritus ſalis Ammoniaci balſamans,</hi> which may be prepared <hi>ex tempore</hi> in the manner following. Take of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes one Pound, pour on them of

Or, which is better, the Corps may be pent down under the Liquor, with a piece or two of a wooden lathe. Then the Veſſel muſt be moſt exactly covered, and the chinks muſt be ſtopt cloſe with a Paper and Paſte; partly that the Volatil Spirits may not fly away; and partly that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air may not get in and corrupt it. The Body being placed in the manner aforeſaid, if it be a large one, muſt be left three Months. Six Weeks is ſufficient for little Creatures. Yea a Month is time long enough for ſome. Then you muſt look whether the Fleſh of the Body be hard or ſoft. They muſt be kept, if poſſible in cool places, rather than in hot and moiſt. This muſt be obſerved eſpecially in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. After two or three Months, the Veſſel may be opened, and the Liquor gently poured off, or taken out. The Body muſt be tenderly handled. When it is taken out of the Veſſel, it may reſt for eighteen or four and twenty hours. Then, to dry up the ſuperfluous moiſture, you may lay it in a ſtove mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot, or ſomtimes upon an Oven; ſomtimes alſo you may lay hot Bricks upon the Belly; or you may wrap it up, and put it in hot Sand, or you may ſtrew hot Sand upon it, eſpecially on the Lower Belly. In Summer time it may be expoſed to the vehement Rays of the Sun. You muſt take notice, that every day you muſt turn the Body on a new ſide; that the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in every place may the better be dried up by the external Heat. And laſt of all, it may be waſht with a Sponge, to clear it of filth, if there be any.</p>
